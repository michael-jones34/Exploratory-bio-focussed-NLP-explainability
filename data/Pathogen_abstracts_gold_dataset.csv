36653801,The role of autophagy in viral infections,"Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved catabolic cellular process that exerts antiviral functions during a viral invasion. However, co-evolution and co-adaptation between viruses and autophagy have armed viruses with multiple strategies to subvert the autophagic machinery and counteract cellular antiviral responses. Specifically, the host cell quickly initiates the autophagy to degrade virus particles or virus components upon a viral infection, while cooperating with anti-viral interferon response to inhibit the virus replication. Degraded virus-derived antigens can be presented to T lymphocytes to orchestrate the adaptive immune response. Nevertheless, some viruses have evolved the ability to inhibit autophagy in order to evade degradation and immune responses. Others induce autophagy, but then hijack autophagosomes as a replication site, or hijack the secretion autophagy pathway to promote maturation and egress of virus particles, thereby increasing replication and transmission efficiency. Interestingly, different viruses have unique strategies to counteract different types of selective autophagy, such as exploiting autophagy to regulate organelle degradation, metabolic processes, and immune responses. In short, this review focuses on the interaction between autophagy and viruses, explaining how autophagy serves multiple roles in viral infection, with either proviral or antiviral functions.",positive,,,,
27392606,Mechanisms of viral mutation,"The remarkable capacity of some viruses to adapt to new hosts and environments is highly dependent on their ability to generate de novo diversity in a short period of time. Rates of spontaneous mutation vary amply among viruses. RNA viruses mutate faster than DNA viruses, single-stranded viruses mutate faster than double-strand virus, and genome size appears to correlate negatively with mutation rate. Viral mutation rates are modulated at different levels, including polymerase fidelity, sequence context, template secondary structure, cellular microenvironment, replication mechanisms, proofreading, and access to post-replicative repair. Additionally, massive numbers of mutations can be introduced by some virus-encoded diversity-generating elements, as well as by host-encoded cytidine/adenine deaminases. Our current knowledge of viral mutation rates indicates that viral genetic diversity is determined by multiple virus- and host-dependent processes, and that viral mutation rates can evolve in response to specific selective pressures.",positive,,,,
36920689,Pseudotyped Viruses,"Pseudotyped viruses have been constructed for many viruses. They can mimic the authentic virus and have many advantages compared to authentic viruses. Thus, they have been widely used as a surrogate of authentic virus for viral function analysis, detection of neutralizing antibodies, screening viral entry inhibitors, and others. This chapter reviewed the progress in the field of pseudotyped viruses in general, including the definition and the advantages of pseudotyped viruses, their potential usage, different strategies or vectors used for the construction of pseudotyped viruses, and factors that affect the construction of pseudotyped viruses.",positive,,,,
36008955,Viral Complexity,"Although traditionally viewed as streamlined and simple, discoveries over the last century have revealed that viruses can exhibit surprisingly complex physical structures, genomic organization, ecological interactions, and evolutionary histories. Viruses can have physical dimensions and genome lengths that exceed many cellular lineages, and their infection strategies can involve a remarkable level of physiological remodeling of their host cells. Virus-virus communication and widespread forms of hyperparasitism have been shown to be common in the virosphere, demonstrating that dynamic ecological interactions often shape their success. And the evolutionary histories of viruses are often fraught with complexities, with chimeric genomes including genes derived from numerous distinct sources or evolved de novo. Here we will discuss many aspects of this viral complexity, with particular emphasis on large DNA viruses, and provide an outlook for future research.",positive,,,,
35412139,Broad-spectrum Respiratory Virus Entry Inhibitors,"With the increasing global human population, travel, and socioeconomic activities, more and more novel pathogenic viruses will emerge or re-emerge. While more than 260 viruses are known to infect humans, only a small minority of these viral diseases are treatable by clinically approved antiviral drugs. Apart from these identified viruses, new emerging viruses and drug-resistant viruses are also important challenges to our public health and healthcare systems. The COVID-19 and influenza pandemics remind us the importance of getting broad-spectrum antivirals against emerging and re-emerging respiratory viruses. Broad-spectrum antivirals against different viral families for fighting the currently known viruses and novel emerging viruses are urgently needed. Viral entry is the universal first step for viral infection, and therefore is a promising target for identifying broad-spectrum antivirals. In this chapter, we mainly focus on discussing the risks of respiratory viruses, the challenge of finding broad-spectrum antivirals, the entry processes of respiratory viruses, the current studies on broad-spectrum entry inhibitors for respiratory viruses, and the directions for discovering broad-spectrum antivirals in the future.",positive,,,,
27177731,Respiratory viruses and children ,"Respiratory viruses place a great disease burden especially on the youngest children in terms of high rates of infection, bacterial complications and hospitalizations. In developing countries, some viral infections are even associated with substantial mortality in children. The interaction between viruses and bacteria is probably much more common and clinically significant than previously understood. Respiratory viruses frequently initiate the cascade of events that ultimately leads to bacterial infection. Effective antiviral agents can substantially shorten the duration of the viral illness and prevent the development of bacterial complications. Viral vaccines have the potential to not only prevent the viral infection but also decrease the incidence of bacterial complications. At present, antivirals and vaccines are only available against influenza viruses, but new vaccines and antivirals against other viruses, especially for RSV, are being developed.",positive,,,,
38140656,Viral-Bacterial Interactions That Impact Viral Thermostability and Transmission ,"Enteric viruses are significant human pathogens that commonly cause foodborne illnesses worldwide. These viruses initiate infection in the gastrointestinal tract, home to a diverse population of intestinal bacteria. In a novel paradigm, data indicate that enteric viruses utilize intestinal bacteria to promote viral replication and pathogenesis. While mechanisms underlying these observations are not fully understood, data suggest that some enteric viruses bind directly to bacteria, stabilizing the virion to retain infectivity. Here, we discuss the current knowledge of these viral-bacterial interactions and examine the impact of these interactions on viral transmission.",positive,,,,
16297742,Viral arthritis,"The role of viruses in the development of acute and chronic arthritis is complex, because viruses are ubiquitous, and all human beings are occasionally afflicted by viral infections. In general, most viral infections are acute and self-limiting and survive by infecting one susceptible host, then moving on to another. Some viruses establish prolonged latency in the host after acute infection, whereas other agents produce chronic infections following the primary stage. The mechanisms whereby these infections produce arthritis are diverse and still poorly understood, but are clearly influenced by both host and viral factors. This review addresses these and other common forms of viral arthritis, such as that caused by parvovirus B19",positive,,,,
27533034,Uncovering Earth's virome,"Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on Earth, but challenges in detecting, isolating, and classifying unknown viruses have prevented exhaustive surveys of the global virome. Here we analysed over 5 Tb of metagenomic sequence data from 3,042 geographically diverse samples to assess the global distribution, phylogenetic diversity, and host specificity of viruses. We discovered over 125,000 partial DNA viral genomes, including the largest phage yet identified, and increased the number of known viral genes by 16-fold. Half of the predicted partial viral genomes were clustered into genetically distinct groups, most of which included genes unrelated to those in known viruses. Using CRISPR spacers and transfer RNA matches to link viral groups to microbial host(s), we doubled the number of microbial phyla known to be infected by viruses, and identified viruses that can infect organisms from different phyla. Analysis of viral distribution across diverse ecosystems revealed strong habitat-type specificity for the vast majority of viruses, but also identified some cosmopolitan groups. Our results highlight an extensive global viral diversity and provide detailed insight into viral habitat distribution and host virus interactions.",positive,,,,
34465172,Illuminating the Virosphere Through Global Metagenomics,"Viruses are the most abundant biological entity on Earth, infect cellular organisms from all domains of life, and are central players in the global biosphere. Over the last century, the discovery and characterization of viruses have progressed steadily alongside much of modern biology. In terms of outright numbers of novel viruses discovered, however, the last few years have been by far the most transformative for the field. Advances in methods for identifying viral sequences in genomic and metagenomic datasets, coupled to the exponential growth of environmental sequencing, have greatly expanded the catalog of known viruses and fueled the tremendous growth of viral sequence databases. Development and implementation of new standards, along with careful study of the newly discovered viruses, have transformed and will continue to transform our understanding of microbial evolution, ecology, and biogeochemical cycles, leading to new biotechnological innovations across many diverse fields, including environmental, agricultural, and biomedical sciences.",positive,,,,
11961194,Viral oncolysis,"The concept of using replicating viruses as anticancer agents is not a new one, but the ability to genetically modify these viruses into increasingly potent and tumor-specific vectors is a recent phenomenon. As more is learned about the functions of viral gene products in controlling the mammalian cell cycle and in disabling cellular defense mechanisms, specific viral functions can be augmented or eliminated to enhance antineoplastic efficacy. In this article, general mechanisms by which oncolytic viruses achieve their antitumor efficacy and specificity are reviewed. The paradoxical roles of the immune response are addressed with respect to oncolytic viral therapy, as it, on one hand, impedes the spread of viral infection, and on the other, augments tumor cell destruction through the recruitment of T cells ""vaccinated"" against tumor antigens. The most commonly used oncolytic viruses are each reviewed in turn, including adenoviruses, herpes simplex viruses, vaccinia viruses, reoviruses, and Newcastle disease viruses. Special attention is focused on the unique biology of each of these viruses as well as the status of several of these mutants in clinical trials.",positive,,,,
17295196,Viral metagenomics,"Characterisation of new viruses is often hindered by difficulties in amplifying them in cell culture, limited antigenic/serological cross-reactivity or the lack of nucleic acid hybridisation to known viral sequences. Numerous molecular methods have been used to genetically characterise new viruses without prior in vitro replication or the use of virus-specific reagents. In the recent metagenomic studies viral particles from uncultured environmental and clinical samples have been purified and their nucleic acids randomly amplified prior to subcloning and sequencing. Already known and novel viruses were then identified by comparing their translated sequence to those of viral proteins in public sequence databases. Metagenomic approaches to viral characterisation have been applied to seawater, near shore sediments, faeces, serum, plasma and respiratory secretions and have broadened the range of known viral diversity. Selection of samples with high viral loads, purification of viral particles, removal of cellular nucleic acids, efficient sequence-independent amplification of viral RNA and DNA, recognisable sequence similarities to known viral sequences and deep sampling of the nucleic acid populations through large scale sequencing can all improve the yield of new viruses. This review lists some of the animal viruses recently identified using sequence-independent methods, current laboratory and bioinformatics methods, together with their limitations and potential improvements. Viral metagenomic approaches provide novel opportunities to generate an unbiased characterisation of the viral populations in various organisms and environments.",positive,,,,
25485129,Viruses and viral proteins,"For more than 30 years X-ray crystallography has been by far the most powerful approach for determining the structures of viruses and viral proteins at atomic resolution. The information provided by these structures, which covers many important aspects of the viral life cycle such as cell-receptor recognition, viral entry, nucleic acid transfer and genome replication, has extensively enriched our vision of the virus world. Many of the structures available correspond to potential targets for antiviral drugs against important human pathogens. This article provides an overview of the current knowledge of different structural aspects of the above-mentioned processes. ",positive,,,,
37982624,Metal-binding proteins and proteases in RNA viruses: unravelling functional diversity and expanding therapeutic horizons ,"Metal-binding proteins are pivotal components with diverse functions in organisms, including viruses. Despite their significance, many metalloproteins in viruses remain uncharacterized, posing challenges to understanding viral systems. This study addresses this knowledge gap by identifying and analyzing metal-binding proteins and proteases in RNA viruses. The findings emphasize the prevalence of these proteins as essential functional classes within viruses and shed light on the role of metal ions and metalloproteins in viral replication and pathogenesis. Moreover, this research serves as a crucial foundation for further investigations in this field, offering the potential for developing innovative antiviral strategies. Additionally, the study enhances our understanding of the distribution and evolutionary patterns of metal-binding proteases in major human viruses. Continually exploring metal-binding proteomes across diverse viruses will deepen our knowledge of metal-dependent biological processes and provide valuable insights for combating viral infections, including respiratory viruses and other life-threatening diseases.

38228165,Viral Pneumonia: From Influenza to COVID-19,"Respiratory viruses are increasingly recognized as a cause of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The implementation of new diagnostic technologies has facilitated their identification, especially in vulnerable population such as immunocompromised and elderly patients and those with severe cases of pneumonia. In terms of severity and outcomes, viral pneumonia caused by influenza viruses appears similar to that caused by non-influenza viruses. Although several respiratory viruses may cause CAP, antiviral therapy is available only in cases of CAP caused by influenza virus or respiratory syncytial virus. Currently, evidence-based supportive care is key to managing severe viral pneumonia. We discuss the evidence surrounding epidemiology, diagnosis, management, treatment, and prevention of viral pneumonia.",positive,,,,
12021080,Viruses and diabetes,"Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is a multifactorial disease. Besides a genetic predisposition environmental factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of beta cell destruction. Among these environmental factors viruses have been the focus of many studies. Some viruses are diabetogenic in animals, and others have been implicated as triggers in human IDDM by temporal and geographical association between IDDM and viral infections, serological evidence of infection in recently diagnosed diabetic patients, and the isolation of viruses from the pancreas of affected individuals. We discuss possible pathomechanisms of viral infections in beta cell destruction and review the studies on involvement of enteroviruses, retroviruses, rubella viruses, cytomegaloviruses, and Epstein-Barr viruses in human IDDM. We also report on studies of diabetogenic viruses in animal models as well as on viral infections protecting from IDDM. Some of the difficulties in linking viral infections to IDDM will be illustrated with data from a transgenic mouse model in which IDDM can be precipitated by infections with certain strains of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Emerging treatment concepts that do not rely on defining the initiating autoantigens but involve self-reactive regulatory lymphocytes such as oral antigen administration, as well as DNA vaccines, will be discussed briefly.

37896936,Trick-or-Trap: Extracellular Vesicles and Viral Transmission,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are lipid membrane-enclosed particles produced by most cells, playing important roles in various biological processes. They have been shown to be involved in antiviral mechanisms such as transporting antiviral molecules, transmitting viral resistance, and participating in antigen presentation. While viral transmission was traditionally thought to occur through independent viral particles, the process of viral infection is complex, with multiple barriers and challenges that viruses must overcome for successful infection. As a result, viruses exploit the intercellular communication pathways of EVs to facilitate cluster transmission, increasing their chances of infecting target cells. Viral vesicle transmission offers two significant advantages. Firstly, it enables the collective transmission of viral genomes, increasing the chances of infection and promoting interactions between viruses in subsequent generations. Secondly, the use of vesicles as vehicles for viral transmission provides protection to viral particles against environmental factors, while also expanding the cell tropism allowing viruses to reach cells in a receptor-independent manner. Understanding the role of EVs in viral transmission is crucial for comprehending virus evolution and developing innovative antiviral strategies, therapeutic interventions, and vaccine approaches.",positive,,,,
20359459,Bacteriophage host range and bacterial resistance,"Host range describes the breadth of organisms a parasite is capable of infecting, with limits on host range stemming from parasite, host, or environmental characteristics. Parasites can adapt to overcome host or environmental limitations, while hosts can adapt to control the negative impact of parasites. We consider these adaptations as they occur among bacteriophages (phages) and their bacterial hosts, since they are significant to phage use as antibacterials (phage therapy) or to protection of industrial ferments from phage attack. Initially, we address how phage host range can (and should) be defined plus summarize claims of host ranges spanning multiple bacterial genera. Subsequently, we review bacterial mechanisms of phage resistance. These include adsorption resistance, which results in reduced interaction between phage and bacterium; what we describe as ""restriction,"" where bacteria live but phages die; and abortive infections, where both phage and bacterium die. Adsorption resistance includes loss of phage receptor molecules on hosts as well as physical barriers hiding receptor molecules (e.g., capsules). Restriction mechanisms include phage-genome uptake blocks, superinfection immunity, restriction modification, and CRISPR, all of which function postphage adsorption but prior to terminal phage takeover of host metabolism. Standard laboratory selection methods, involving exposure of planktonic bacteria to high phage densities, tend to directly select for these prehost-takeover resistance mechanisms. Alternatively, resistance mechanisms that do not prevent bacterium death are less readily artificially selected. Contrasting especially bacteria mutation to adsorption resistance, these latter mechanisms likely are an underappreciated avenue of bacterial resistance to phage attack.",positive,,,,
39508659,Untangling bacterial DNA topoisomerases functions,"Topoisomerases are the main enzymes capable of resolving the topological constraints imposed by DNA transactions such as transcription or replication. All bacteria possess topoisomerases of different types. Although bacteria with circular replicons should encounter similar DNA topology issues, the distribution of topoisomerases varies from one bacterium to another, suggesting polymorphic functioning. Recently, several proteins restricting, enhancing or modifying the activity of topoisomerases were discovered, opening the way to a new area of understanding DNA topology management during the bacterial cell cycle. In this review, we discuss the distribution of topoisomerases across the bacterial phylum and current knowledge on the interplay among the different topoisomerases to maintain topological homeostasis.",positive,,,,
28664324,Considerations on bacterial nucleoids,"The classic genome organization of the bacterial chromosome is normally envisaged with all its genetic markers linked, thus forming a closed genetic circle of duplex stranded DNA (dsDNA) and several proteins in what it is called as ""the bacterial nucleoid."" This structure may be more or less corrugated depending on the physiological state of the bacterium (i.e., resting state or active growth) and is not surrounded by a double membrane as in eukayotic cells. The universality of the closed circle model in bacteria is however slowly changing, as new data emerge in different bacterial groups such as in Planctomycetes and related microorganisms, species of Borrelia, Streptomyces, Agrobacterium, or Phytoplasma. In these and possibly other microorganisms, the existence of complex formations of intracellular membranes or linear chromosomes is typical; all of these situations contributing to weakening the current cellular organization paradigm, i.e., prokaryotic vs eukaryotic cells.",positive,,,,
33583696,Making Sense of the Biodiversity and Virulence of Listeria monocytogenes ,"Listeria monocytogenes is a foodborne pathogen responsible for listeriosis, an infection that can manifest in humans as bacteremia, meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised patients and the elderly, and fetal-placental infection in pregnant women. Reference strains from this facultative intracellular bacterium have been instrumental in the investigation of basic mechanisms in microbiology, immunology, and cell biology. The integration of bacterial population genomics with environmental, epidemiological, and clinical data allowed the uncovering of new factors involved in the virulence of L. monocytogenes and its adaptation to different environments. This review illustrates how these investigations have led to a better understanding of the bacterium's virulence and the driving forces that shaped it.",positive,,,,
22672649,Top 10 plant pathogenic bacteria in molecular plant pathology,"Many plant bacteriologists, if not all, feel that their particular microbe should appear in any list of the most important bacterial plant pathogens. However, to our knowledge, no such list exists. The aim of this review was to survey all bacterial pathologists with an association with the journal Molecular Plant Pathology and ask them to nominate the bacterial pathogens they would place in a 'Top 10' based on scientific/economic importance. The survey generated 458 votes from the international community, and allowed the construction of a Top 10 bacterial plant pathogen list. The list includes, in rank order: (1) Pseudomonas syringae pathovars; (2) Ralstonia solanacearum; (3) Agrobacterium tumefaciens; (4) Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae; (5) Xanthomonas campestris pathovars; (6) Xanthomonas axonopodis pathovars; (7) Erwinia amylovora; (8) Xylella fastidiosa; (9) Dickeya (dadantii and solani); (10) Pectobacterium carotovorum (and Pectobacterium atrosepticum). Bacteria garnering honourable mentions for just missing out on the Top 10 include Clavibacter michiganensis (michiganensis and sepedonicus), Pseudomonas savastanoi and Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus. This review article presents a short section on each bacterium in the Top 10 list and its importance, with the intention of initiating discussion and debate amongst the plant bacteriology community, as well as laying down a benchmark. It will be interesting to see, in future years, how perceptions change and which bacterial pathogens enter and leave the Top 10.",positive,,,,
33934682,Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus: a potential 'living antibiotic' to control bacterial pathogens,"Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is a small Deltaproteobacterium which, since its discovery, has distinguished itself for the unique ability to prey on other Gram-negative bacteria. The studies on this particular ""predatory bacterium"", have gained momentum in response to the rising problem of antibiotic resistance, because it could be applied as a potential probiotic and antibiotic agent. Hereby, we present recent advances in the study of B. bacteriovorus, comprehending fundamental aspects of its biology, obligatory intracellular life cycle, predation resistance, and potential applications. Furthermore, we discuss studies that pave the road towards the use of B. bacteriovorus as a ""living antibiotic"" in human therapy, focussing on its interaction with biofilms, the host immune response, predation susceptibility and in vivo application models. The available data imply that it will be possible to upgrade this predator bacterium from a predominantly academic interest to an instrument that could confront antibiotic resistant infections.",positive,,,,
30217844,Phage-Antibiotic Synergy via Delayed Lysis,"When phages infect bacteria cultured in the presence of sublethal doses of antibiotics, the sizes of the phage plaques are significantly increased. This phenomenon is known as phage-antibiotic synergy (PAS). In this study, the observation of PAS was extended to a wide variety of bacterium-phage pairs using different classes of antibiotics. PAS was shown in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Cells stressed with ?-lactam antibiotics filamented or swelled extensively, resulting in an increase in phage production. PAS was also sometimes observed in the presence of other classes of antibiotics with or without bacterial filamentation. The addition of antibiotics induced recA expression in various bacteria, but a recA deletion mutant strain of Escherichia coli also showed filamentation and PAS in the presence of quinolone antibiotics. The phage adsorption efficiency did not change in the presence of the antibiotics when the cell surfaces were enlarged as they filamented. Increases in the production of phage DNA and mRNAs encoding phage proteins were observed in these cells, with only a limited increase in protein production. The data suggest that PAS is the product of a prolonged period of particle assembly due to delayed lysis. The increase in the cell surface area far exceeded the increase in phage holin production in the filamented host cells, leading to a relatively limited availability of intracellular holins for aggregating and forming holes in the host membrane. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress also led to an increased production of phages, while heat stress resulted in only a limited increase in phage production.IMPORTANCE Phage-antibiotic synergy (PAS) has been reported for a decade, but the underlying mechanism has never been vigorously investigated. This study shows the presence of PAS from a variety of phage-bacterium-antibiotic pairings. We show that increased phage production resulted directly from a lysis delay caused by the relative shortage of holin in filamented bacterial hosts in the presence of sublethal concentrations of stress-inducing substances, such as antibiotics and reactive oxygen species (ROS).",positive,,,,
31587897,Peptidoglycan Production by an Insect-Bacterial Mosaic,"Peptidoglycan (PG) is a defining feature of bacteria, involved in cell division, shape, and integrity. We previously reported that several genes related to PG biosynthesis were horizontally transferred from bacteria to the nuclear genome of mealybugs. Mealybugs are notable for containing a nested bacteria-within-bacterium endosymbiotic structure in specialized insect cells, where one bacterium, Moranella, lives in the cytoplasm of another bacterium, Tremblaya. Here we show that horizontally transferred genes on the mealybug genome work together with genes retained on the Moranella genome to produce a PG layer exclusively at the Moranella cell periphery. Furthermore, we show that an insect protein encoded by a horizontally transferred gene of bacterial origin is transported into the Moranella cytoplasm. These results provide a striking parallel to the genetic and biochemical mosaicism found in organelles, and prove that multiple horizontally transferred genes can become integrated into a functional pathway distributed between animal and bacterial endosymbiont genomes.",negative,,,,
34186025,Phages carry interbacterial weapons encoded by biosynthetic gene clusters,"Bacteria produce diverse specialized metabolites that mediate ecological interactions and serve as a rich source of industrially relevant natural products. Biosynthetic pathways for these metabolites are encoded by organized groups of genes called biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Understanding the natural function and distribution of BGCs provides insight into the mechanisms through which microorganisms interact and compete. Further, understanding BGCs is extremely important for biocontrol and the mining of new bioactivities. Here, we investigated phage-encoded BGCs (pBGCs), challenging the relationship between phage origin and BGC structure and function. The results demonstrated that pBGCs are rare, and they predominantly reside within temperate phages infecting commensal or pathogenic bacterial hosts. Further, the vast majority of pBGCs were found to encode for bacteriocins. Using the soil- and gut-associated bacterium Bacillus subtilis, we experimentally demonstrated how a temperate phage equips a bacterium with a fully functional BGC, providing a clear competitive fitness advantage over the ancestor. Moreover, we demonstrated a similar transfer of the same phage in prophage form. Finally, using genetic and genomic comparisons, a strong association between pBGC type and phage host range was revealed. These findings suggest that bacteriocins are encoded in temperate phages of a few commensal bacterial genera. In these cases, lysogenic conversion provides an evolutionary benefit to the infected host and, hence, to the phage itself. This study is an important step toward understanding the natural role of bacterial compounds encoded by BGCs, the mechanisms driving their horizontal transfer, and the sometimes mutualistic relationship between bacteria and temperate phages.",positive,,,,
27294402,Bacterial Alkaloids Prevent Amoebal Predation,"Bacterial defense mechanisms have evolved to protect bacteria against predation by nematodes, predatory bacteria, or amoebae. We identified novel bacterial alkaloids (pyreudiones A-D) that protect the producer, Pseudomonas fluorescens HKI0770, against amoebal predation. Isolation, structure elucidation, total synthesis, and a proposed biosynthetic pathway for these structures are presented. The generation of P. fluorescens gene-deletion mutants unable to produce pyreudiones rendered the bacterium edible to a variety of soil-dwelling amoebae.",positive,,,,
37930554,Quantitative Determination of Antibacterial Activity During Bacterial Coculture,"Antibacterial activity assays are an important tool in the assessment of the ability of one bacterium to kill or inhibit the growth of another, for example, during the study of the Type VI secretion system (T6SS) and the antibacterial toxins it secretes. The method we describe here can detect the ability of a bacterial strain to kill or inhibit other bacterial cells in a contact-dependent manner when cocultured on an agar surface. It is particularly useful since it enumerates the recovery of viable target cells and thus enables quantification of the antibacterial activity. We provide a detailed description of how to measure the T6SS-dependent antibacterial activity of a bacterium such as Serratia marcescens against a competitor prokaryotic organism, Escherichia coli, and describe possible variations in the method to allow adaptation to other attacker and target organisms.",positive,,,,
34252073,Identification and engraftment of new bacterial strains by shotgun metagenomic sequence analysis in patients with recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection before and after fecal microbiota transplantation and in healthy human subjects," Background: Recurrent Clostridioides diff cile infection (RCDI) is associated with major bacterial dysbiosis and colitis. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a highly effective therapeutic modality for RCDI. While several studies have identified bacterial species associated with resolution of symptoms in patients, characterization of the fecal microbiome at the bacterial strain level in RCDI patients before and after FMT and healthy donors, has been lacking. The aim of this study was to examine the ability of bacterial strains from healthy donors to engraft in the gastrointestinal tract of patients with RCDI following FMT.

Methods: Fecal samples were collected from 22 patients with RCDI before and after FMT and their corresponding healthy donors. Total DNA was extracted from each sample and analyzed by shotgun metagenomic sequencing. The Cosmos-ID analysis platform was used for taxonomic assignment of sequences and calculation of the relative abundance (RA) of bacterial species and strains. From these data, the total number of bacterial strains (BSI), Shannon diversity index, dysbiosis index (DI), and bacterial engraftment factor, were calculated for each strain.

Findings: A marked reduction (p<0 0001) in the RA of total and specific bacterial strains, especially from phylum Firmicutes, was observed in RCDI patients prior to FMT. This change was associated with an increase in the DI (p<0 0001) and in pathobiont bacterial strains from phylum Proteobacteria, such as Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Klebsiella pneumoniae UCI 34. BSI was significantly lower in this group of patients as compared to healthy donors and correlated with the Shannon Index. (p<0 0001). Identification and engraftment of bacterial strains from healthy donors revealed a greater diversity and higher relative abundance of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacterial strains, including Lachnospiraceae bacterium 5_1_63FAA_u_t, Dorea formicigenerans ATCC 27755, Anaerostipes hadrusand others, in RCDI patients after FMT.

31885873,Comparison of Japanese and Indian intestinal microbiota shows diet-dependent interaction between bacteria and fungi ,"The bacterial species living in the gut mediate many aspects of biological processes such as nutrition and activation of adaptive immunity. In addition, commensal fungi residing in the intestine also influence host health. Although the interaction of bacterium and fungus has been shown, its precise mechanism during colonization of the human intestine remains largely unknown. Here, we show interaction between bacterial and fungal species for utilization of dietary components driving their efficient growth in the intestine. Next generation sequencing of fecal samples from Japanese and Indian adults revealed differential patterns of bacterial and fungal composition. In particular, Indians, who consume more plant polysaccharides than Japanese, harbored increased numbers of Prevotella and Candida. Candida spp. showed strong growth responses to the plant polysaccharide arabinoxylan in vitro. Furthermore, the culture supernatants of Candida spp. grown with arabinoxylan promoted rapid proliferation of Prevotella copri. Arabinose was identified as a potential growth-inducing factor in the Candida culture supernatants. Candida spp. exhibited a growth response to xylose, but not to arabinose, whereas P. copri proliferated in response to both xylose and arabinose. Candida spp., but not P. copri, colonized the intestine of germ-free mice. However, P. copri successfully colonized mouse intestine already harboring Candida. These findings demonstrate a proof of concept that fungal members of gut microbiota can facilitate a colonization of the intestine by their bacterial counterparts, potentially mediated by a dietary metabolite.",negative,,,,
29975902,Diamond nanoparticles suppress lateral growth of bacterial colonies,"Diamond nanoparticles (DNPs) of various types have been recently reported to possess antibacterial properties. Studies have shown a decrease of the colony forming ability on agar plates of the bacteria that had been previously co-incubated with DNPs in the suspension. Before plating, bacteria with DNPs were adequately diluted in order to obtain a suitable number of colony forming units. However, residual DNPs were still present on an agar plate, concentrated on the surface during the plating process; this introduces a potential artifact which might affect colony growth. The effect of DNPs remaining on the surface, alongside growing bacteria, has not been previously investigated. In this work, we present the experiments designed to investigate the effect of DNPs on bacterial survival and on the growth of the bacterial colony on a solid media. We employed Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis as models of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, respectively, and Proteus mirabilis as a model of bacterium exhibiting swarming motility on the surfaces. We analyzed the number, area, and weight of bacterial colonies grown on the agar surface covered with DNPs. We did not observe any bactericidal effect of such applied DNPs. However, in all bacterial species used in this work, we observed the appreciable reduction of colony area, which suggests that DNPs obstruct either bacterial growth or motility. The most obvious effect on colony growth was observed in the case of motile P. mirabilis. We show that DNPs act as the mechanical barrier blocking the lateral colony growth.",positive,,,,
34040152,A human respiratory tract-associated bacterium with an extremely small genome,"Recent advances in culture-independent microbiological analyses have greatly expanded our understanding of the diversity of unculturable microbes. However, human pathogenic bacteria differing significantly from known taxa have rarely been discovered. Here, we present the complete genome sequence of an uncultured bacterium detected in human respiratory tract named IOLA, which was determined by developing a protocol to selectively amplify extremely AT-rich genomes. The IOLA genome is 303,838 bp in size with a 20.7% GC content, making it the smallest and most AT-rich genome among known human-associated bacterial genomes to our best knowledge and comparable to those of insect endosymbionts. While IOLA belongs to order Rickettsiales (mostly intracellular parasites), the gene content suggests an epicellular parasitic lifestyle. Surveillance of clinical samples provides evidence that IOLA can be predominantly detected in patients with respiratory bacterial infections and can persist for at least 15 months in the respiratory tract, suggesting that IOLA is a human respiratory tract-associated bacterium.",positive,,,,
38443279,The macrophage-bacterium mismatch in persister formation,"Many pathogens are hard to eradicate, even in the absence of genetically detectable antimicrobial resistance mechanisms and despite proven antibiotic susceptibility. The fraction of clonal bacteria that temporarily elude effective antibiotic treatments is commonly known as 'antibiotic persisters.' Over the past decade, there has been a growing body of research highlighting the pivotal role played by the cellular host in the development of persisters. In parallel, this research has also sought to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of intracellular antibiotic persisters and has demonstrated a prominent role for the bacterial stress response. However, questions remain regarding the conditions leading to the formation of stress-induced persisters among a clonal population of intracellular bacteria and despite an ostensibly uniform environment. In this opinion, following a brief review of the current state of knowledge regarding intracellular antibiotic persisters, we explore the ways in which macrophage functional heterogeneity and bacterial phenotypic heterogeneity may contribute to the emergence of these persisters. We propose that the degree of mismatch between the macrophage permissiveness and the bacterial preparedness to invade and thrive intracellularly may explain the formation of stress-induced nonreplicating intracellular persisters.",positive,,,,
11781270,"Bacterial endophthalmitis: epidemiology, therapeutics, and bacterium-host interactions","Endophthalmitis is a severe inflammation of the interior of the eye caused by the introduction of contaminating microorganisms following trauma, surgery, or hematogenous spread from a distant infection site. Despite appropriate therapeutic intervention, bacterial endophthalmitis frequently results in visual loss, if not loss of the eye itself. Although the pathogenicity of bacterial endophthalmitis has historically been linked with toxin production during infection, a paucity of information exists as to the exact mechanisms of retinal toxicity and the triggers for induction of the intraocular immune response. Recently, research has begun to examine the bacterial and host molecular and cellular events that contribute to ocular damage during endophthalmitis. This review focuses on the causative agents and therapeutic challenges of bacterial endophthalmitis and provides current data from the analysis of the role of bacterial virulence factors and host inflammatory interactions in the pathogenesis of eye infections. Based on these and related studies, a hypothetical model for the molecular pathogenesis of bacterial endophthalmitis is proposed. Identifying and understanding the basic mechanisms of these bacterium-host interactions will provide the foundation for which novel, information-based therapeutic agents are developed in order to prevent vision loss during endophthalmitis.

25398865,Ecological succession and viability of human-associated microbiota on restroom surfaces,"Human-associated bacteria dominate the built environment (BE). Following decontamination of floors, toilet seats, and soap dispensers in four public restrooms, in situ bacterial communities were characterized hourly, daily, and weekly to determine their successional ecology. The viability of cultivable bacteria, following the removal of dispersal agents (humans), was also assessed hourly. A late-successional community developed within 5 to 8 h on restroom floors and showed remarkable stability over weeks to months. Despite late-successional dominance by skin- and outdoor-associated bacteria, the most ubiquitous organisms were predominantly gut-associated taxa, which persisted following exclusion of humans. Staphylococcus represented the majority of the cultivable community, even after several hours of human exclusion. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)-associated virulence genes were found on floors but were not present in assembled Staphylococcus pan-genomes. Viral abundances, which were predominantly enterophages, human papilloma virus, and herpesviruses, were significantly correlated with bacterial abundances and showed an unexpectedly low virus-to-bacterium ratio in surface-associated samples, suggesting that bacterial hosts are mostly dormant on BE surfaces.

26942418,Anti-virulence Strategies to Target Bacterial Infections,"Resistance of important bacterial pathogens to common antimicrobial therapies and the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria are increasing at an alarming rate and constitute one of our greatest challenges in the combat of bacterial infection and accompanied diseases. The current shortage of effective drugs, lack of successful prevention measures and only a few new antibiotics in the clinical pipeline demand the development of novel treatment options and alternative antimicrobial therapies. Our increasing understanding of bacterial virulence strategies and the induced molecular pathways of the infectious disease provides novel opportunities to target and interfere with crucial pathogenicity factors or virulence-associated traits of the bacteria while bypassing the evolutionary pressure on the bacterium to develop resistance. In the past decade, numerous new bacterial targets for anti-virulence therapies have been identified, and structure-based tailoring of intervention strategies and screening assays for small-molecule inhibitors of such pathways were successfully established. In this chapter, we will take a closer look at the bacterial virulence-related factors and processes that present promising targets for anti-virulence therapies, recently discovered inhibitory substances and their promises and discuss the challenges, and problems that have to be faced.",positive,,,,
37779323,IWGDF/IDSA guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes-related foot infections (IWGDF/IDSA 2023),"The International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) has published evidence-based guidelines on the management and prevention of diabetes-related foot diseases since 1999. The present guideline is an update of the 2019 IWGDF guideline on the diagnosis and management of foot infections in persons with diabetes mellitus. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was used for the development of this guideline. This was structured around identifying clinically relevant questions in the P(A)ICO format, determining patient-important outcomes, systematically reviewing the evidence, assessing the certainty of the evidence, and finally moving from evidence to the recommendation. This guideline was developed for healthcare professionals involved in diabetes-related foot care to inform clinical care around patient-important outcomes. Two systematic reviews from 2019 were updated to inform this guideline, and a total of 149 studies (62 new) meeting inclusion criteria were identified from the updated search and incorporated in this guideline. Updated recommendations are derived from these systematic reviews, and best practice statements made where evidence was not available. Evidence was weighed in light of benefits and harms to arrive at a recommendation. The certainty of the evidence for some recommendations was modified in this update with a more refined application of the GRADE framework centred around patient important outcomes. This is highlighted in the rationale section of this update. A note is also made where the newly identified evidence did not alter the strength or certainty of evidence for previous recommendations. The recommendations presented here continue to cover various aspects of diagnosing soft tissue and bone infections, including the classification scheme for diagnosing infection and its severity. Guidance on how to collect microbiological samples, and how to process them to identify causative pathogens, is also outlined. Finally, we present the approach to treating foot infections in persons with diabetes, including selecting appropriate empiric and definitive antimicrobial therapy for soft tissue and bone infections; when and how to approach surgical treatment; and which adjunctive treatments may or may not affect the infectious outcomes of diabetes-related foot problems. We believe that following these recommendations will help healthcare professionals provide better care for persons with diabetes and foot infections, prevent the number of foot and limb amputations, and reduce the patient and healthcare burden of diabetes-related foot disease.",positive,,,,
38625646,Skin Deep: The Potential of Microbiome Cosmetics,"The interplay between the skin microbiome and its host is a complex facet of dermatological health and has become a critical focus in the development of microbiome cosmetics. The skin microbiome, comprising various microorganisms, is essential from birth, develops over the lifespan, and performs vital roles in protecting our body against pathogens, training the immune system, and facilitating the breakdown of organic matter. Dysbiosis, an imbalance of these microorganisms, has been implicated in a number of skin conditions such as acne, atopic dermatitis, and skin cancer. Recent scientific findings have spurred cosmetic companies to develop products that preserve and enhance the skin's microbial diversity balance. These products may incorporate elements like prebiotics, probiotics, and postbiotics, which are beneficial for the skin microbiome. Beyond topical products, there's increasing interest in ingestible beauty supplements (i.e. oral probiotics), highlighting the connection between the gut and skin. This review examines the influence of the microbiome on skin health and the emerging trends of microbiome skincare products.",positive,,,,
37734419,"Pathobionts in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Origins, Underlying Mechanisms, and Implications for Clinical Care","The gut microbiota plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of both forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), namely, Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Although evidence suggests dysbiosis and loss of beneficial microbial species can exacerbate IBD, many new studies have identified microbes with pathogenic qualities, termed ""pathobionts,"" within the intestines of patients with IBD. The concept of pathobionts initiating or driving the chronicity of IBD has largely focused on the putative aggravating role that adherent invasive Escherichia coli may play in CD. However, recent studies have identified additional bacterial and fungal pathobionts in patients with CD and UC. This review will highlight the characteristics of these pathobionts and their implications for IBD treatment. Beyond exploring the origins of pathobionts, we discuss those associated with specific clinical features and the potential mechanisms involved, such as creeping fat (Clostridium innocuum) and impaired wound healing (Debaryomyces hansenii) in patients with CD as well as the increased fecal proteolytic activity (Bacteroides vulgatus) seen as a biomarker for UC severity. Finally, we examine the potential impact of pathobionts on current IBD therapies, and several new approaches to target pathobionts currently in the early stages of development. Despite recognizing that pathobionts likely contribute to the pathogenesis of IBD, more work is needed to define their modes of action. Determining whether causal relationships exist between pathobionts and specific disease characteristics could pave the way for improved care for patients, particularly for those not responding to current IBD therapies.

The aim of the manuscript is to review the aortic involvement and complications in MFS, including aortal dissection, thoracic aortic aneurysm, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and acute aortic syndrome. Dissecting thoracic aortic aneurysm and progressing aortic root enlargement are the major causes of MFS morbidity and mortality. Guidelines on aortic disease endorsed by the American College of Cardiology, and the American Heart Association recommend the measurement of the external and internal aortic diameters perpendicular to the axis of blood flow when Computed Tomography, or Magnetic Resonance Imaging, or Cardiac Echography are performed. The pathophysiology, diagnosis, prevention, and medical and surgical treatments of MFS associated with aortic complications are reported in this narrative review. Development and strengthening of centers specialized in cardiovascular diseases and MFS, together with an improvement in the knowledge of its pathogenesis through genetics and proteomics investigations, can ameliorate the prognosis of this disease.",negative,,,,
38362561,Subchorionic hematoma: Research status and pathogenesis (Review),"Subchorionic hematoma (SCH) is a hematoma in which blood accumulates between the chorion and decidua basalis due to the separation of the chorion and decidua basalis. It is common in patients with threatened abortion in early pregnancy and is mainly detected by ultrasound. SCH mainly manifests as an hypoechoic or anechoic crescent-shaped fluid dark area on ultrasound images. Although there are numerous studies on SCH, its pathogenesis and etiology remain unclear, and its influence on pregnancy outcomes is also controversial; there are also no uniform clinical treatment guidelines. Current studies suggest that the occurrence of SCH may be related to several factors, such as abnormal coagulation function, autoimmune factors of pregnant women, assisted reproduction, drug use during pregnancy and reproductive tract infection; however, its exact etiology remains unclear. Some studies suggest that SCH is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes such as miscarriage, preterm birth, preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction, although other studies have found that SCH does not increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, the present review mainly discusses the pathogenesis, etiology and treatment of SCH in an aim to provide a reference for the clinical treatment of this condition in pregnant women.",negative,,,,
39334403,"Hand and environmental hygiene: respective roles for MRSA, multi-resistant gram negatives, Clostridioides difficile, and Candida spp","Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) caused by multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) represent a global threat to human health and well-being. Because transmission of MDROs to patients often occurs via transiently contaminated hands of healthcare personnel (HCP), hand hygiene is considered the most important measure for preventing HAIs. Environmental surfaces contaminated with MDROs from colonized or infected patients represent an important source of HCP hand contamination and contribute to transmission of pathogens. Accordingly, facilities are encouraged to adopt and implement recommendations included in the World Health Organization hand hygiene guidelines and those from the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America/Infectious Diseases Society of America/Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology. Alcohol-based hand rubs are efficacious against MDROs with the exception of Clostridiodes difficile, for which soap and water handwashing is indicated. Monitoring hand hygiene adherence and providing HCP with feedback are of paramount importance. Environmental hygiene measures to curtail MDROs include disinfecting high-touch surfaces in rooms of patients with C. difficile infection daily with a sporicidal agent such as sodium hypochlorite. Some experts recommend also using a sporicidal agent in rooms of patients colonized with C. difficile, and for patients with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide, or peracetic acid solutions are often used for daily and/or terminal disinfection of rooms housing patients with Candida auris or other MDROs. Products containing only a quaternary ammonium agent are not as effective as other agents against C. auris. Portable medical equipment should be cleaned and disinfected between use on different patients. Detergents are not recommended for cleaning high-touch surfaces in MDRO patient rooms, unless their use is followed by using a disinfectant. Facilities should consider using a disinfectant instead of detergents for terminal cleaning of floors in MDRO patient rooms. Education and training of environmental services employees is essential in assuring effective disinfection practices. Monitoring disinfection practices and providing personnel with performance feedback using fluorescent markers, adenosine triphosphate assays, or less commonly cultures of surfaces, can help reduce MDRO transmission. No-touch disinfection methods such as electrostatic spraying, hydrogen peroxide vapor, or ultraviolet light devices should be considered for terminal disinfection of MDRO patient rooms. Bundles with additional measures are usually necessary to reduce MDRO transmission.",positive,,,,
39052018,Lung antimicrobial proteins and peptides: from host defense to therapeutic strategies,"Representing severe morbidity and mortality globally, respiratory infections associated with chronic respiratory diseases, including complicated pneumonia, asthma, interstitial lung disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, are a major public health concern. Lung health and the prevention of pulmonary disease rely on the mechanisms of airway surface fluid secretion, mucociliary clearance, and adequate immune response to eradicate inhaled pathogens and particulate matter from the environment. The antimicrobial proteins and peptides contribute to maintaining an antimicrobial milieu in human lungs to eliminate pathogens and prevent them from causing pulmonary diseases. The predominant antimicrobial molecules of the lung environment include human ?- and ?-defensins and cathelicidins, among numerous other host defense molecules with antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity such as PLUNC (palate, lung, and nasal epithelium clone) family proteins, elafin, collectins, lactoferrin, lysozymes, mucins, secretory leukocyte proteinase inhibitor, surfactant proteins SP-A and SP-D, and RNases. It has been demonstrated that changes in antimicrobial molecule expression levels are associated with regulating inflammation, potentiating exacerbations, pathological changes, and modifications in chronic lung disease severity. Antimicrobial molecules also display roles in both anticancer and tumorigenic effects. Lung antimicrobial proteins and peptides are promising alternative therapeutics for treating and preventing multidrug-resistant bacterial infections and anticancer therapies. ",positive,,,,
38844367,"Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein Astrocytopathy: Review of Pathogenesis, Imaging Features, and Radiographic Mimics","Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) astrocytopathy is a recently described autoimmune inflammatory disorder of the CNS characterized by the presence of specific antibodies targeting the intracellular filament protein in mature astrocytes. The pathogenesis is heterogeneous and poorly understood, with around 20%-34% of cases occurring as a paraneoplastic syndrome, most frequently associated with ovarian teratomas. It presents clinically as acute or subacute encephalomyelitis, and the diagnosis relies on imaging and detection of GFAP-Immunoglobulin (GFAP-IgG) in the CSF. Characteristic imaging findings include linear perivascular enhancement in the white matter extending in a radial pattern. Other imaging findings include periependymal enhancement, longitudinally extensive cord signal changes, intramedullary enhancement, optic neuritis, and papillitis. There is significant imaging overlap with other neuroinflammatory diseases like neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and lymphoproliferative conditions. GFAP astrocytopathy is characteristically responsive to steroids with, however, a significant rate of relapse. Currently, literature on this novel entity is limited with no established diagnostic criteria or standard treatment regimen. This comprehensive review explores the clinical, radiographic, and histopathologic aspects of GFAP astrocytopathy, shedding light on its complex nature and potential diagnostic challenges. The paper highlights the neuroimaging findings with a focus on differentiating GFAP astrocytopathy from other neuroinflammatory disorders.",negative,,,,
40041912,Oxidative stress and inflammation in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders: Mechanisms and implications ,"Neuroprotection is a proactive approach to safeguarding the nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves, by preventing or limiting damage to nerve cells and other components. It primarily defends the central nervous system against injury from acute and progressive neurodegenerative disorders. Oxidative stress, an imbalance between the body's natural defense mechanisms and the generation of reactive oxygen species, is crucial in developing neurological disorders. Due to its high metabolic rate and oxygen consumption, the brain is particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress. Excessive ROS damages the essential biomolecules, leading to cellular malfunction and neurodegeneration. Several neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and ischemic stroke, are associated with oxidative stress. Understanding the impact of oxidative stress in these conditions is crucial for developing new treatment methods. Researchers are exploring using antioxidants and other molecules to mitigate oxidative stress, aiming to prevent or slow down the progression of brain diseases. By understanding the intricate interplay between oxidative stress and neurological disorders, scientists hope to pave the way for innovative therapeutic and preventive approaches, ultimately improving individuals' living standards.",negative,,,,
39839113,Diabetes and gut microbiome,"Diabetes mellitus represents a significant global health problem. The number of people suffering from this metabolic disease is constantly rising and although the incidence is heterogeneous depending on region, country, economic situation, lifestyle, diet and level of medical care, it is increasing worldwide, especially among youths and children, mainly due to lifestyle and environmental changes. The pathogenesis of the two most common subtypes of diabetes mellitus, type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 (T2DM), is substantially different, so each form is characterized by a different causation, etiology, pathophysiology, presentation, and treatment. Research in recent decades increasingly indicates the potential role of the gut microbiome in the initiation, development, and progression of this disease. Intestinal microbes and their fermentation products have an important impact on host metabolism, immune system, nutrient digestion and absorption, gut barrier integrity and protection against pathogens. This review summarizes the current evidence on the changes in gut microbial populations in both types of diabetes mellitus. Attention is focused on changes in the abundance of specific bacterial groups at different taxonomic levels in humans, and microbiome shift is also assessed in relation to geographic location, age, diet and antidiabetic drug. The causal relationship between gut bacteria and diabetes is still unclear, and future studies applying new methodological approaches to a broader range of microorganisms inhabiting the digestive tract are urgently needed. This would not only provide a better understanding of the role of the gut microbiome in this metabolic disease, but also the use of beneficial bacterial species in the form of probiotics for the treatment of diabetes.",negative,,,,

38405060,Cholesterol metabolism: physiological regulation and diseases,"Cholesterol homeostasis is crucial for cellular and systemic function. The disorder of cholesterol metabolism not only accelerates the onset of cardiovascular disease (CVD) but is also the fundamental cause of other ailments. The regulation of cholesterol metabolism in the human is an extremely complex process. Due to the dynamic balance between cholesterol synthesis, intake, efflux and storage, cholesterol metabolism generally remains secure. Disruption of any of these links is likely to have adverse effects on the body. At present, increasing evidence suggests that abnormal cholesterol metabolism is closely related to various systemic diseases. However, the exact mechanism by which cholesterol metabolism contributes to disease pathogenesis remains unclear, and there are still unknown factors. In this review, we outline the metabolic process of cholesterol in the human body, especially reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). Then, we discuss separately the impact of abnormal cholesterol metabolism on common diseases and potential therapeutic targets for each disease, including CVD, tumors, neurological diseases, and immune system diseases. At the end of this review, we focus on the effect of cholesterol metabolism on eye diseases. In short, we hope to provide more new ideas for the pathogenesis and treatment of diseases from the perspective of cholesterol.",negative,,,,

40023755,Antifungal pipeline: New tools for the treatment of mycoses,"Fungal infections are becoming an escalating public health challenge, particularly among immunocompromised individuals. The partially limited efficacy of current antifungal treatments, their potential adverse effects, and the increasing problem of resistance emphasize the need for new treatment options. Existing antifungal classes-allylamines, azoles, echinocandins, polyenes, and pyrimidine analogs-face challenges due to their similarity with human cells and rising resistance. New antifungal agents, such as ibrexafungerp, rezafungin, oteseconazole, and miltefosine, offer novel mechanisms of action along with reduced toxicity. While antifungal resistance is a growing global concern, fungal infections in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) present specific challenges with high rates of opportunistic infections like cryptococcosis and endemic mycoses such as histoplasmosis. The World Health Organization's fungal priority pathogens list highlights the prevalence of these infections in LMICs, where limited access to antifungal drugs and misuse are common. This review provides a comprehensive overview of these new agents and their mechanisms, and explores the challenges and roles of antifungal drugs in LMICs, where the burden of fungal infections is high.

39858553,Hypoxia-Inducible Factor in Renal Cell Carcinoma: From Molecular Insights to Targeted Therapies,"Mutations of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene occur frequently in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC), the predominant histology of kidney cancer, and have been associated with its pathogenesis and progression. Alterations of VHL lead to impaired degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1? (HIF1?) and HIF2? promoting neoangiogenesis, which is pivotal for cancer growth. As such, targeting the VHL-HIF axis holds relevant potential for therapeutic purposes. Belzutifan, an HIF-2? inhibitor, has been recently indicated for metastatic RCC and other antiangiogenic drugs directed against HIF-2? are currently under investigation. Further, clinical and preclinical studies of combination approaches for metastatic RCC including belzutifan with cyclin-dependent kinase 4-6 inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or immune checkpoint inhibitors achieved promising results or are ongoing.

40012912,Immunologic and inflammatory consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its implications in renal disease,"The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic made it critical to understand the immune and inflammatory responses to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It became increasingly recognized that the immune response was a key mediator of illness severity and that its mechanisms needed to be better understood. Early infection of both tissue and immune cells, such as macrophages, leading to pyroptosis-mediated inflammasome production in an organ system critical for systemic oxygenation likely plays a central role in the morbidity wrought by SARS-CoV-2. Delayed transcription of Type I and Type III interferons by SARS-CoV-2 may lead to early disinhibition of viral replication. Cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor ? (TNF?), some of which may be produced through mechanisms involving nuclear factor kappa B (NF-?B), likely contribute to the hyperinflammatory state in patients with severe COVID-19. Lymphopenia, more apparent among natural killer (NK) cells, CD8+ T-cells, and B-cells, can contribute to disease severity and may reflect direct cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2 or end-organ sequestration. Direct infection and immune activation of endothelial cells by SARS-CoV-2 may be a critical mechanism through which end-organ systems are impacted. In this context, endovascular neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation and microthrombi development can be seen in the lungs and other critical organs throughout the body, such as the heart, gut, and brain. The kidney may be among the most impacted extrapulmonary organ by SARS-CoV-2 infection owing to a high concentration of ACE2 and exposure to systemic SARS-CoV-2. In the kidney, acute tubular injury, early myofibroblast activation, and collapsing glomerulopathy in select populations likely account for COVID-19-related AKI and CKD development. The development of COVID-19-associated nephropathy (COVAN), in particular, may be mediated through IL-6 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling, suggesting a direct connection between the COVID-19-related immune response and the development of chronic disease. Chronic manifestations of COVID-19 also include systemic conditions like Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) and Adults (MIS-A) and post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), which may reflect a spectrum of clinical presentations of persistent immune dysregulation. The lessons learned and those undergoing continued study likely have broad implications for understanding viral infections' immunologic and inflammatory consequences beyond coronaviruses.",positive,,,,
39353317,Dysbiosis and diabetic foot ulcers: A metabolic perspective of Staphylococcus aureus infection,"Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) infection is the most prevalent and resistant bacterial infection, posing a worldwide health risk. Compared with healthy people, diabetes patients with weak immune function and abnormal metabolism are more vulnerable to bacterial infection, which aggravates the intensity of infection and causes a series of common and dangerous complications, such as diabetes foot ulcer (DFU). Due to metabolic abnormalities of diabetic patients, S. aureus on the skin surface of DFU transitions from a commensal to an invasive infection. During this process, S. aureus resists a series of unfavorable conditions for bacterial growth by altering energy utilization and metabolic patterns, and secretes various virulence factors, causing persistent infection. With the emergence of multiple super-resistant bacteria, antibiotic treatment is no longer the only treatment option, and developing new drugs and therapies is urgent. Regulating the metabolic signaling pathway of S. aureus plays a decisive role in regulating its virulence factors and impacts adjuvant therapy for DFU. This article focuses on studying the impact of regulating metabolic signals on the virulence of S. aureus from a metabolism perspective. It provides an outlook on the future direction of the novel development of antimicrobial therapy.",positive,,,,
40078733,Biosafety and immunology: An interdisciplinary field for health priority ,"Biosafety hazards can trigger a host immune response after infection, invasion, or contact with the host. Whether infection with a microorganism results in disease or biosafety concerns depends to a large extent on the immune status of the population. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the immunological characteristics of the host and the mechanisms of biological threats and agents to protect the host more effectively. Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, such as the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, have raised concerns regarding both biosafety and immunology worldwide. Interdisciplinary studies involved in biosafety and immunology are relevant in many fields, including the development of vaccines and other immune interventions such as monoclonal antibodies and T-cells, herd immunity (or population-level barrier immunity), immunopathology, and multispecies immunity, i.e., animals and even plants. Meanwhile, advances in immunological science and technology are occurring rapidly, resulting in important research achievements that may contribute to the recognition of emerging biosafety hazards, as well as early warning, prevention, and defense systems.

37744960,Evaluating immune responses to pneumococcal vaccines,"Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is a significant cause of bacterial infections ranging from mild infections affecting the respiratory tract such as otitis media and sinusitis to severe diseases including bacteremia, pneumonia, and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) (eg, meningitis, septic arthritis, and endocarditis). Pneumococcal vaccines were first developed in the 1970s as capsular pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines, which were T-cell independent and hence lacked immunologic memory. Subsequently in the year 2000, pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) conjugated to a protein to increase immunogenicity were developed and made commercially available. The increasing number of pneumococcal serotypes identified and the expanding pipeline of PCV vaccines with improved immunogenicity have significantly reduced the morbidity and mortality associated with IPD in high-risk patients. Pneumococcal vaccines also play an important role in the diagnosis and immunophenotyping of children and adults with inborn errors of immunity (IEI) given the increasing diversity/heterogeneity of IEI presenting with primary and/or specific antibody deficiency. Other than the quantitation of serotype levels in routine clinical care, other measurements of immune response including the functional activity of antibodies, antibody avidity, cell-mediated immunity, and immunological memory remain limited to clinical trials during vaccine development.",positive,,,,

Background: In recent years, several interesting case reports have been published which describe the possible role of SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination in the etiopathogenesis of Lipsch tz ulcer. Our aim is to analyze this association and provide a rapid algorithm that is of support to gynecologists and dermatologists both in the diagnosis and in setting up the therapy. To do so, in this paper, we describe an interesting case of acute vulvar ulcer triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection and review the related literature.

Methods: We conducted a literature review including papers published between October 2021 and April 2023, and we described the case of a patient referred to our clinic with Lipsch tz ulcer and SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Results: In almost all cases analyzed, a correlation with SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination was found; ulcers usually manifest after 2 to 4 weeks and are associated with flu-like symptoms. A concordance in review papers, as well as in our case report, was also found about the treatment, which is mainly symptomatic.

Conclusions: Previous infection or vaccination for SARS-CoV-2 should be included as possible etiopathogenetic factors in the onset of Lipsch tz ulcer.

39310786,Autophagy: the misty lands of Chlamydia trachomatis infection,"Chlamydia are Gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens that infect eukaryotic cells and reside within a host-derived vacuole known as the inclusion. To facilitate intracellular replication, these bacteria must engage in host-pathogen interactions to obtain nutrients and membranes required for the growth of the inclusion, thereby sustaining prolonged bacterial colonization. Autophagy is a highly conserved process that delivers cytoplasmic substrates to the lysosome for degradation. Pathogens have developed strategies to manipulate and/or exploit autophagy to promote their replication and persistence. This review delineates recent advances in elucidating the interplay between Chlamydia trachomatis infection and autophagy in recent years, emphasizing the intricate strategies employed by both the Chlamydia pathogens and host cells. Gaining a deeper understanding of these interactions could unveil novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of Chlamydia infection.",positive,,,,
39339670,Assessment of Supplementation with Different Biomolecules in the Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19,"Consequences of the disease produced by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have led to an urgent search for preventive and therapeutic strategies. Besides drug treatments, proposals have been made for supplementation with biomolecules possessing immunomodulatory and antioxidant properties. The objective of this study was to review published evidence on the clinical usefulness of supplementation with vitamin D, antioxidant vitamins (vitamin A, vitamin E, and vitamin C), melatonin, lactoferrin and natural products found in food (curcumin, luteolin, ginger, allicin, magnesium and zinc) as supplements in SARS-CoV-2 infection. In general, supplementation of conventional treatments with these biomolecules has been found to improve the clinical symptoms and severity of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), with some indications of a preventive effect. In conclusion, these compounds may assist in preventing and/or improving the symptoms of COVID-19. Nevertheless, only limited evidence is available, and findings have been inconsistent. Further investigations are needed to verify the therapeutic potential of these supplements. ",positive,,,,
37486266,"Clinical Characteristics of Corynebacterium ulcerans Infection, Japan","Corynebacterium ulcerans is a closely related bacterium to the diphtheria bacterium C. diphtheriae, and some C. ulcerans strains produce toxins that are similar to diphtheria toxin. C. ulcerans is widely distributed in the environment and is considered one of the most harmful pathogens to livestock and wildlife. Infection with C. ulcerans can cause respiratory or nonrespiratory symptoms in patients. Recently, the microorganism has been increasingly recognized as an emerging zoonotic agent of diphtheria-like illness in Japan. To clarify the overall clinical characteristics, treatment-related factors, and outcomes of C. ulcerans infection, we analyzed 34 cases of C. ulcerans that occurred in Japan during 2001-2020. During 2010-2020, the incidence rate of C. ulcerans infection increased markedly, and the overall mortality rate was 5.9%. It is recommended that adults be vaccinated with diphtheria toxoid vaccine to prevent the spread of this infection.",positive,,,,
39829652,Avian influenza in birds: Insights from a comprehensive review,"One of the worst zoonotic illnesses, avian influenza (AI), or commonly referred to as bird flu, is caused by viruses belonging to the genus Influenza viruses, which are members of the Orthomyxoviridae family. The harmful effects of AI illness can affect both human and animal health and cause financial losses. Globally, the AI virus lacks political purpose and is not limited by geographical limits. It has been isolated from poultry, wild birds, and captive birds in Asia, North America, Europe, Australia, and South America. Their virulence is divided into highly pathogenic AI (HPAI) and low pathogenic AI (LPAI). The AI virus can also be diagnosed in a laboratory setting using molecular tests like real-time polymerase chain reaction or serological tests like the hemagglutinin inhibition test, agar gel immunodiffusion, antigen detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and other immunoassays. The type of AI virus and host species determines the clinical manifestations, severity, and fatality rates of AI. Human infection with AI viruses typically results from direct transmission from infected birds to humans. AI outbreaks in domestic and wild birds are uncommon; however, an infection can pose a significant threat to public, veterinary, and medical health. Successful vaccination reduces the probability of AI H5N1 virus infection in meat and other poultry products and prevents systemic infection in chickens. This review will provide information that can be used as a reference for recognizing the dangers of AI and for preventing and controlling the disease, considering its potential to become a serious pandemic outbreak.",positive,,,,
40045940,Beyond Antibiotics: Exploring the Potential of Bacteriophages and Phage Therapy,"The escalating global threat of antibiotic resistance has prompted a critical need for innovative approaches to bacterial infection treatment. In terms of management, bacterial-associated disorders have reached a critical point in the world due to the advent of drug-resistant types of bacteria. Nonetheless, continued bacteriophage research presents a promising frontier in the battle against bacterial infections. In this study, we explored the effectiveness of bacteriophage therapy against antibiotic-resistant bacteria. According to our viewpoint, phage therapy could replace antibiotics in terms of safety, efficacy, and specificity. Furthermore, phage therapy offers versatility in administering single phage, phage products, or modified phage against various resistant bacteria. Moreover, Phage cocktails, with their synergistic combinations, showcase a holistic approach, mitigating the risk of resistance and expanding treatment possibilities. Similarly, the synergy between phages and antibiotics holds promise for overcoming antibiotic resistance and forging a path toward more effective and sustainable antimicrobial strategies. The review provides insights into the transformative impact of bacteriophage therapy on current bacterial infection treatment paradigms, its application with methodological challenges and limitations, as well as insights to scientists and policymakers on the best areas to study phages in order to combat antimicrobial resistance.",positive,,,,
39772781,Acute hand infections and surgical treatment,"Hand infection is a common and frequent problem encountered by surgeons in their outpatient clinics. The causes are varied, ranging from trauma to surgical intervention and to the spread of infection from elsewhere on the body. The causative agents of infection are also varied, and although bacteria are the most common ones, viruses, fungi, and, of course, the problem of diagnosis after parasite infestation as well as rare causes of infections must also be considered. The diagnosis should be quick and the treatment should be as aggressive as possible without undue delay in a justified situation. This will avoid serious complications and consequences of infection on such a complex structure as the hand. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the problem, and to provide information to support early diagnosis.

On a country level, the prevalence of chronic HBV infection varies between 0.1% and 35.0%, depending on the locality and the population being investigated. One-third of all liver cancer fatalities worldwide are attributable to HBV. The adoption of standard birth-dose immunization exerted the most significant impact on the decline of HBV prevalence. HCC incidence ranges from 0.01% to 1.40% in noncirrhotic patients and from 0.9% to 5.4% annually, in the settings of liver cirrhosis. Although antiviral therapy significantly reduces the risk of developing HBV-related HCC, studies have demonstrated that the risk persists, and that HCC screening is still essential. This review discusses the complex relationship between HBV infection and HCC, recent epidemiological data, different aspects of clinical disease characteristics, and the impact of antiviral therapy in this context.",positive,,,,
39693583,Reemerging Infectious Diseases and Neuroimmunologic Complications,"During the past decade (and beyond), neurologists have become aware of the emergence, persistence, and consequences of some familiar and new infections affecting the nervous system. Even among the familiar CNS infections, such as herpes virus, polyoma virus/JC, influenza, arbovirus, and hepatitis, challenges remain in developing effective antiviral treatments and treatments of postinfection sequelae. With the changing environment and increased global travel, arthropod vectors that mediate zoonotic disease transmission have spread unfamiliar viruses such as West Nile virus, dengue, chikungunya, equine encephalitis, and Zika, among others. Although the global health impact of these diseases has not risen to that of COVID-19 and HIV, it is likely to dramatically increase with continued spread of transmission vectors and the emergence of new zoonotic animal-to-human diseases mediated by those transmission vectors. Furthermore, specific virus-targeting treatments or effective vaccines for arboviral infections are not yet available, and this represents a major challenge in limiting the morbidity of these infections. By contrast, HIV-1, a disease that originated by direct transmission from nonhuman primates to humans (as early as the 1930s), after many years of intense study, is now targeted by highly specific and effective antiviral drugs that can limit the spread of infection and extend human life and health in all populations. Even with these dramatic therapeutic effects of suppressing HIV replication, neurologic dysfunction (primarily cognitive impairment) affects significant numbers of persons living with HIV. This emphasizes not only the importance of treating the underlying infection but also developing treatments for legacy effects of the initial infection even after antiviral therapy. Notably, the rapid emergence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was met with rapid implementation of highly effective and specific antiviral therapies. This resulted in early and dramatic lowering of the morbidity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nonetheless, the postinfectious complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection (long COVID) are now among the more costly consequences of emerging zoonotic infections worldwide. Developing new antiviral therapies that can penetrate the CNS, vaccines, and therapies that target host immune responses and metabolic dysfunction will be necessary for management of infectious and postinfectious complications of established and emerging infections.",positive,,,,

It is well established that alterations in the balance of living microbiota can contribute to various health problems, such as inflammatory bowel disease and autoimmune disorders. Probiotics administered in sufficient quantities as functional food ingredients provide health benefits to hosts. They help to maintain the stability and composition of the gut microbiota and provide resistance to infection by pathogens. The most important probiotic bacteria are Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacteria spp., which protect the intestine through various mechanisms such as the production of organic acids and bacteriocins.

39526838,Nomenclature for human and animal fungal pathogens and diseases: a proposal for standardized terminology,"Medically important pathogenic fungi invade vertebrate tissue and are considered primary when part of their nature life cycle is associated with an animal host and are usually able to infect immunocompetent hosts. Opportunistic fungal pathogens complete their life cycle in environmental habitats or occur as commensals within or on the vertebrate body, but under certain conditions can thrive upon infecting humans. The extent of host damage in opportunistic infections largely depends on the portal and modality of entry as well as on the host's immune and metabolic status. Diseases caused by primary pathogens and common opportunists, causing the top approximately 80% of fungal diseases [D. W. Denning, Lancet Infect Dis, 24:e428-e438, 2024, https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(23)00692-8], tend to follow a predictive pattern, while those by occasional opportunists are more variable. For this reason, it is recommended that diseases caused by primary pathogens and the common opportunists are named after the etiologic agent, for example, histoplasmosis and aspergillosis, while this should not be done for occasional opportunists that should be named as [causative fungus] [clinical syndrome], for example, Alternaria alternata cutaneous infection. The addition of a descriptor that identifies the location or clinical type of infection is required, as the general name alone may cover widely different clinical syndromes, for example, ""rhinocerebral mucormycosis."" A list of major recommended human and animal disease entities (nomenclature) is provided in alignment with their causative agents. Fungal disease names may encompass several genera of etiologic agents, consequently being less susceptible to taxonomic changes of the causative species, for example, mucormycosis covers numerous mucormycetous molds.",positive,,,,
39695812,Are we cultivating the perfect storm for a human avian influenza pandemic?,"The emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A H5N1 virus in dairy cattle marks a troubling new chapter in the ongoing battle against zoonotic diseases. Since its initial detection in 1955, the H5N1 virus has primarily been associated with poultry, posing significant threats to both animal and human health. However, recent outbreaks in U.S. dairy herds across nine states have revealed an alarming expansion of the virus, with over 190 herds affected as of September 2024. This unprecedented spread in cattle has sparked intense concern among scientists and health officials, especially with reports indicating that up to 20% of dairy products may contain traces of the virus. The implications of the H5N1 virus establishing itself in cattle populations are profound. This potential endemic presence could transform dairy farms into reservoirs of the virus, facilitating its evolution and increasing the risk of human transmission. Mutations enhancing viral replication in mammals have already been identified, including the notorious PB2 E627K mutation linked to increased virulence. Moreover, the detection of the virus in the central nervous system of infected animals, including cats, underscores the broad tissue tropism and severe pathogenic potential of the H5N1 virus. Current containment efforts include stringent biosecurity measures and financial incentives for enhanced testing and personal protective equipment (PPE) for farmers. Yet, gaps in testing infrastructure and the resurgence of raw milk consumption pose significant challenges. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) emphasize the critical need for comprehensive testing and pasteurization to mitigate the risk of human infection. As the scientific community races to adapt existing antiviral treatments and develop effective vaccines, the concept of a One Health approach becomes increasingly vital. This holistic strategy calls for coordinated actions across human, animal, and environmental health sectors to preemptively tackle emerging zoonotic threats. Strengthening surveillance, fostering international cooperation, and investing in research are essential steps to prevent the H5N1 virus from igniting the next global health crisis. The current avian influenza outbreak serves as a stark reminder of the delicate balance between human activities and viral evolution. Our collective ability to respond effectively and proactively will determine whether we can avert the perfect storm brewing on the horizon.",positive,,,,

37248233,Highly lethal genotype I and II recombinant African swine fever viruses detected in pigs,"African swine fever virus (ASFV) poses a great threat to the global pig industry and food security. Currently, 24 ASFV genotypes have been reported but it is unclear whether recombination of different genotype viruses occurs in nature. In this study, we detect three recombinants of genotype I and II ASFVs in pigs in China. These recombinants are genetically similar and classified as genotype I according to their B646L gene, yet 10 discrete fragments accounting for over 56% of their genomes are derived from genotype II virus. Animal studies with one of the recombinant viruses indicate high lethality and transmissibility in pigs, and deletion of the virulence-related genes MGF_505/360 and EP402R derived from virulent genotype II virus highly attenuates its virulence. The live attenuated vaccine derived from genotype II ASFV is not protective against challenge of the recombinant virus. These naturally occurring recombinants of genotype I and II ASFVs have the potential to pose a challenge to the global pig industry.",positive,,,,
37322051,Evolutionary and functional history of the Escherichia coli K1 capsule,"Escherichia coli is a leading cause of invasive bacterial infections in humans. Capsule polysaccharide has an important role in bacterial pathogenesis, and the K1 capsule has been firmly established as one of the most potent capsule types in E. coli through its association with severe infections. However, little is known about its distribution, evolution and functions across the E. coli phylogeny, which is fundamental to elucidating its role in the expansion of successful lineages. Using systematic surveys of invasive E. coli isolates, we show that the K1-cps locus is present in a quarter of bloodstream infection isolates and has emerged in at least four different extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) phylogroups independently in the last 500 years. Phenotypic assessment demonstrates that K1 capsule synthesis enhances E. coli survival in human serum independent of genetic background, and that therapeutic targeting of the K1 capsule re-sensitizes E. coli from distinct genetic backgrounds to human serum. Our study highlights that assessing the evolutionary and functional properties of bacterial virulence factors at population levels is important to better monitor and predict the emergence of virulent clones, and to also inform therapies and preventive medicine to effectively control bacterial infections whilst significantly lowering antibiotic usage.",positive,,,,
38042959,Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates with features of both multidrug-resistance and hypervirulence have unexpectedly low virulence,"Klebsiella pneumoniae has been classified into two types, classical K. pneumoniae (cKP) and hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvKP). cKP isolates are highly diverse and important causes of nosocomial infections; they include globally disseminated antibiotic-resistant clones. hvKP isolates are sensitive to most antibiotics but are highly virulent, causing community-acquired infections in healthy individuals. The virulence phenotype of hvKP is associated with pathogenicity loci responsible for siderophore and hypermucoid capsule production. Recently, convergent strains of K. pneumoniae, which possess features of both cKP and hvKP, have emerged and are cause of much concern. Here, we screen the genomes of 2,608 multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates from the United States and identify 47 convergent isolates. We perform phenotypic and genomic characterization of 12 representative isolates. These 12 convergent isolates contain a variety of antimicrobial resistance plasmids and virulence plasmids. Most convergent isolates contain aerobactin biosynthesis genes and produce more siderophores than cKP isolates but not more capsule. Unexpectedly, only 1 of the 12 tested convergent isolates has a level of virulence consistent with hvKP isolates in a murine pneumonia model. These findings suggest that additional studies should be performed to clarify whether convergent strains are indeed more virulent than cKP in mouse and human infections. ",positive,,,,
35949187,Virulence Variability and Genetic Diversity in Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei in Southeastern and Southwestern China,"Powdery mildew is a key airborne foliar disease of barley in southeastern and southwestern China. Barley varieties usually partially or wholly lose resistance to the pathogen Blumeria graminis (DC.) f. sp. hordei 3 to 5 years after release due to the frequent acquirements of new virulences in the pathogen population. However, no B. graminis f. sp. hordei virulence detection has been carried out in the recent decade and, thus, no information is available on the present virulence components and major pathotypes in epidemic regions. Twenty-one near-isogenic lines of Pallas were selected to detect B. graminis f. sp. hordei virulence variation, with 97 pathotypes identified from the isolates collected from 2015 to 2019. The virulence complexities ranged from 1 to 12, with 1.5 isolates on average assigned per pathotype, suggesting a natural trait of high pathotype diversity and low virulence complexity in the Chinese B. graminis f. sp. hordei populations. Eleven high-virulence pathotypes were detected in the traditional barley-growing regions in Yunnan and Zhejiang. Six virulent pathotypes to resistance gene mlo-5 were detected only in the two traditional epidemic regions, with a virulence frequency (VF) of 4.8% (7 of 147). Compared with the results from a decade ago, VFs for resistance alleles Mla3, mlo-5, Mla6 + Mla14, Mla7 + Mlk, Mlg + MlCP, and Mla13 + MlRu3 + MlaRu4 increased from 0 to 0.7 to 25.8%.

37142361,Botryosphaeriaceae gene machinery: Correlation between diversity and virulence,"The Botryosphaeriaceae family comprises numerous fungal pathogens capable of causing economically meaningful diseases in a wide range of crops. Many of its members can live as endophytes and turn into aggressive pathogens following the onset of environmental stress events. Their ability to cause disease may rely on the production of a broad set of effectors, such as cell wall-degrading enzymes, secondary metabolites, and peptidases. Here, we conducted comparative analyses of 41 genomes representing six Botryosphaeriaceae genera to provide insights into the genetic features linked to pathogenicity and virulence. We show that these Botryosphaeriaceae genomes possess a large diversity of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes; 128 families) and peptidases (45 families). Botryosphaeria, Neofusicoccum, and Lasiodiplodia presented the highest number of genes encoding CAZymes involved in the degradation of the plant cell wall components. The genus Botryosphaeria also exhibited the highest abundance of secreted CAZymes and peptidases. Generally, the secondary metabolites gene cluster profile was consistent in the Botryosphaeriaceae family, except for Diplodia and Neoscytalidium. At the strain level, Neofusicoccum parvum NpBt67 stood out among all the Botryosphaeriaceae genomes, presenting a higher number of secretome constituents. In contrast, the Diplodia strains showed the lowest richness of the pathogenicity- and virulence-related genes, which may correlate with their low virulence reported in previous studies. Overall, these results contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying pathogenicity and virulence in remarkable Botryosphaeriaceae species. Our results also support that Botryosphaeriaceae species could be used as an interesting biotechnological tool for lignocellulose fractionation and bioeconomy.",positive,,,,
39585888,Genetic diversity and virulence variability of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum in Eastern and Northeastern India,"Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, the necrotrophic cosmopolitan fungus, has become an emerging and re-emerging pathogen in the subtropical regions. Genetic diversity of 36 isolates of the fungus isolated from infected samples collected from the eastern and North eastern states was carried out using UP-PCR and SSR. Virulence variability was analysed based on four different measures. Among the eight UP-PCR primers and various combinations used, L-21, 3-2 and AA2M2-AS4 generated maximum number of fingerprints (13, 13 and 12, respectively) ranging from 100bp to 1kb. The isolates exhibited varied level of aggressiveness; majority (77.78%) were moderately virulent, 8.33% (22.22% of Assam and 6.67% of West Bengal) isolates were highly virulent, and 13.89% were less virulent. Several amplification products viz., 500bp generated by AA2M2-AS4, 150bp by AA2M2-L-21 and 100bp by L-21-3-2 were positively correlated with disease severity grading at 5% level of significance, whereas, 600bp band generated by AA2M2-3-2 was correlated at 1% level of significance. This indicates presence of these bands in highly virulent isolates. Out of the eight SSR primers, TATG9 did not generate any amplification and the isolates were divided into two major groups; the group II contained single isolate from Nagaland (NG4) indicating it to be genetically diverse from rest of the isolates. The subgroup A of the major group I was the largest and most diverse group with 11 members indicating genetic admixture within different geographic populations with different levels of similarity (70-100%). Genetic diversity based on SSR banding pattern showed highest value of Nei's gene diversity and Shannon's index of diversity (%pb = 61.11; h = 0.219; I = 0.330) for the Nagaland population with 9 members followed by West Bengal population with 15 members. Nei's genetic distance of all the tested populations was low, ranging from 0.0014 to 0.2350; however, genetic identity was high ranging from 0.7905 to 0.9986. The findings suggest that the pathogen populations of eastern and North eastern region were predominantly clonal with some evidence of infrequent out crossing.",positive,,,,
37498866,Genomic characterization and virulence of Streptococcus suis serotype 4 clonal complex 94 recovered from human and swine samples,"Streptococcus suis is a zoonotic pathogen that causes invasive infections in humans and pigs. Herein, we performed genomic analysis of seven S. suis serotype 4 strains belonging to clonal complex (CC) 94 that were recovered from a human patient or from diseased and clinically healthy pigs. Genomic exploration and comparisons, as well as in vitro cytotoxicity tests, indicated that S. suis CC94 serotype 4 strains are potentially virulent. Genomic analysis revealed that all seven strains clustered within minimum core genome group 3 (MCG-3) and had a high number of virulence-associated genes similar to those of virulent serotype 2 strains. Cytotoxicity assays showed that both the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line and HeLa cells rapidly lost viability following incubation for 4 h with the strains at a concentration of 106 bacterial cells. The human serotype 4 strain (ID36054) decreased cell viability profoundly and similarly to the control serotype 2 strain P1/7. In addition, strain ST1689 (ID34572), isolated from a clinically healthy pig, presented similar behaviour in an adenocarcinoma cell line and HeLa cells. The antimicrobial resistance genes tet(O) and ermB that confer resistance to tetracyclines, macrolides, and lincosamides were commonly found in the strains. However, aminoglycoside and streptothricin resistance genes were found only in certain strains in this study. Our results indicate that S. suis CC94 serotype 4 strains are potentially pathogenic and virulent and should be monitored.",positive,,,,

Pathotype Identification and Virulence Variation in Cochliobolus sativus in China. ","Spot blotch caused by Cochliobolus sativus has become an important disease in the wheat-growing regions in China that has resulted from changes in the regional climate, agricultural cultivation patterns, and the susceptible wheat varieties that are widely grown. Little information is available about virulence variability and pathogenic specialization of the C. sativus isolates from major wheat-growing regions in China. Here, 12 representative wheat varieties and foundation breeding stocks were selected to characterize the pathotypes of C. sativus isolates from infected wheat plants. Based on the infection phenotypes in the 12 differential genotypes at the seedling stage, 70 Chinese pathotypes were identified from 110 isolates and clustered into three virulence groups. The high virulence isolates were collected from wheat leaves, crowns, and roots, with most (10 of 14) from the Henan province in the Huang-Huai plain. No relationship was evident between virulence variability of C. sativus isolates and their geographic origins or types of diseased wheat tissues. C. sativus showed a significant pathogenic specialization in hosts of wheat and barley. Most of the wheat isolates (50 of 65) were avirulent to all the differential barley genotypes, and a few were virulent only to highly susceptible barley genotypes. These results indicated that C. sativus isolates from the wheat-growing regions in China varied considerably for their virulence in wheat varieties, and showed significant pathogenic specialization to the wheat and barley hosts.",positive,,,,
35349342,Bats host the most virulent-but not the most dangerous-zoonotic viruses,"The clear need to mitigate zoonotic risk has fueled increased viral discovery in specific reservoir host taxa. We show that a combination of viral and reservoir traits can predict zoonotic virus virulence and transmissibility in humans, supporting the hypothesis that bats harbor exceptionally virulent zoonoses. However, pandemic prevention requires thinking beyond zoonotic capacity, virulence, and transmissibility to consider collective ""burden"" on human health. For this, viral discovery targeting specific reservoirs may be inefficient as death burden correlates with viral, not reservoir, traits, and depends on context-specific epidemiological dynamics across and beyond the human-animal interface. These findings suggest that longitudinal studies of viral dynamics in reservoir and spillover host populations may offer the most effective strategy for mitigating zoonotic risk.",positive,,,,
36196537,Higher phage virulence accelerates the evolution of host resistance,"Pathogens vary strikingly in their virulence and the selection they impose on their hosts. While the evolution of different virulence levels is well studied, the evolution of host resistance in response to different virulence levels is less understood and, at present, mainly based on observations and theoretical predictions with few experimental tests. Increased virulence can increase selection for host resistance evolution if the benefits of avoiding infection outweigh resistance costs. To test this, we experimentally evolved the bacterium Vibrio alginolyticus in the presence of two variants of a filamentous phage that differ in their virulence. The bacterial host exhibited two alternative defence strategies: (1) super infection exclusion (SIE), whereby phage-infected cells were immune to subsequent infection at the cost of reduced growth, and (2) surface receptor mutations (SRM), providing resistance to infection by preventing phage attachment. While SIE emerged rapidly against both phages, SRM evolved faster against the high- than the low-virulence phage. Using a mathematical model of our system, we show that increasing virulence strengthens selection for SRM owing to the higher costs of infection suffered by SIE immune hosts. Thus, by accelerating the evolution of host resistance, more virulent phages caused shorter epidemics.",positive,,,,
35837851,Reversible mutations in gliding motility and virulence genes: A flexible and efficient phage defence mechanism in Flavobacterium psychrophilum,"Flavobacteria are among the most important pathogens in freshwater salmonid aquaculture worldwide. Due to concerns regarding development of antibiotic resistance, phage therapy has been proposed as a solution to decrease pathogen load. However, application of phages is challenged by the development of phage resistance, and knowledge of the mechanisms and implications of phage resistance is therefore required. To study this, 27 phage-resistant isolates of F. psychrophilum were genome sequenced and characterized to identify genetic modifications and evaluate changes in phenotypic traits, including virulence against rainbow trout. Phage-resistant isolates showed reduction or loss of gliding motility, proteolytic activity, and adhesion to surfaces, and most isolates were completely non-virulent against rainbow trout fry. Genomic analysis revealed that most phage-resistant isolates had mutations in genes associated with gliding motility and virulence. Reversal of these mutations in a sub-set of isolates led to regained motility, proteolytic activity, virulence and phage susceptibility. Although costly, the fast generation of phage resistance driven by single, reversible mutations likely represents a flexible and efficient phage defence mechanism in F. psychrophilum. The results further suggest that phage administration in aquaculture systems to prevent F. psychrophilum outbreaks selects for non-virulent phage-resistant phenotypes.",positive,,,,
35761183,Comparative genomics analysis and virulence-related factors in novel Aliarcobacter faecis and Aliarcobacter lanthieri species identified as potential opportunistic pathogens,"

Background: Emerging pathogenic bacteria are an increasing threat to public health. Two recently described species of the genus Aliarcobacter, A. faecis and A. lanthieri, isolated from human or livestock feces, are closely related to Aliarcobacter zoonotic pathogens (A. cryaerophilus, A. skirrowii, and A. butzleri). In this study, comparative genomics analysis was carried out to examine the virulence-related, including virulence, antibiotic, and toxin (VAT) factors in the reference strains of A. faecis and A. lanthieri that may enable them to become potentially opportunistic zoonotic pathogens.

Results: Our results showed that the genomes of the reference strains of both species have flagella genes (flaA, flaB, flgG, flhA, flhB, fliI, fliP, motA and cheY1) as motility and export apparatus, as well as genes encoding the Twin-arginine translocation (Tat) (tatA, tatB and tatC), type II (pulE and pulF) and III (fliF, fliN and ylqH) secretory pathways, allowing them to secrete proteins into the periplasm and host cells. Invasion and immune evasion genes (ciaB, iamA, mviN, pldA, irgA and fur2) are found in both species, while adherence genes (cadF and cj1349) are only found in A. lanthieri. Acid (clpB), heat (clpA and clpB), osmotic (mviN), and low-iron (irgA and fur2) stress resistance genes were observed in both species, although urease genes were not found in them. In addition, arcB, gyrA and gyrB were found in both species, mutations of which may mediate the resistance to quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs). Furthermore, 11 VAT genes including six virulence (cadF, ciaB, irgA, mviN, pldA, and tlyA), two antibiotic resistance [tet(O) and tet(W)] and three cytolethal distending toxin (cdtA, cdtB, and cdtC) genes were validated with the PCR assays. A. lanthieri tested positive for all 11 VAT genes. By contrast, A. faecis showed positive for ten genes except for cdtB because no PCR assay for this gene was available for this species.

Conclusions: The identification of the virulence, antibiotic-resistance, and toxin genes in the genomes of A. faecis and A. lanthieri reference strains through comparative genomics analysis and PCR assays highlighted the potential zoonotic pathogenicity of these two species. However, it is necessary to extend this study to include more clinical and environmental strains to explore inter-species and strain-level genetic variations in virulence-related genes and assess their potential to be opportunistic pathogens for animals and humans.

36747219,Combined pangenomics and transcriptomics reveals core and redundant virulence processes in a rapidly evolving fungal plant pathogen ,"

Background: Studying genomic variation in rapidly evolving pathogens potentially enables identification of genes supporting their ""core biology"", being present, functional and expressed by all strains or ""flexible biology"", varying between strains. Genes supporting flexible biology may be considered to be ""accessory"", whilst the ""core"" gene set is likely to be important for common features of a pathogen species biology, including virulence on all host genotypes. The wheat-pathogenic fungus Zymoseptoria tritici represents one of the most rapidly evolving threats to global food security and was the focus of this study.

Results: We constructed a pangenome of 18 European field isolates, with 12 also subjected to RNAseq transcription profiling during infection. Combining this data, we predicted a ""core"" gene set comprising 9807 sequences which were (1) present in all isolates, (2) lacking inactivating polymorphisms and (3) expressed by all isolates. A large accessory genome, consisting of 45% of the total genes, was also defined. We classified genetic and genomic polymorphism at both chromosomal and individual gene scales. Proteins required for essential functions including virulence had lower-than average sequence variability amongst core genes. Both core and accessory genomes encoded many small, secreted candidate effector proteins that likely interact with plant immunity. Viral vector-mediated transient in planta overexpression of 88 candidates failed to identify any which induced leaf necrosis characteristic of disease. However, functional complementation of a non-pathogenic deletion mutant lacking five core genes demonstrated that full virulence was restored by re-introduction of the single gene exhibiting least sequence polymorphism and highest expression.

Conclusions: These data support the combined use of pangenomics and transcriptomics for defining genes which represent core, and potentially exploitable, weaknesses in rapidly evolving pathogens.

37702517,High-throughput functional trait testing for bacterial pathogens,"Functional traits are characteristics that affect the fitness and metabolic function of a microorganism. There is growing interest in using high-throughput methods to characterize bacterial pathogens based on functional virulence traits. Traditional methods that phenotype a single organism for a single virulence trait can be time consuming and labor intensive. Alternatively, machine learning of whole-genome sequences (WGS) has shown some success in predicting virulence. However, relying solely on WGS can miss functional traits, particularly for organisms lacking classical virulence factors. We propose that high-throughput assays for functional virulence trait identification should become a prominent method of characterizing bacterial pathogens on a population scale. This work is critical as we move from compiling lists of bacterial species associated with disease to pathogen-agnostic approaches capable of detecting novel microbes. We discuss six key areas of functional trait testing and how advancing high-throughput methods could provide a greater understanding of pathogens.",positive,,,,
36792876,"Vibrio vulnificus, an Underestimated Zoonotic Pathogen","V. vulnificus, continues being an underestimated yet lethal zoonotic pathogen. In this chapter, we provide a comprehensive review of numerous aspects of the biology, epidemiology, and virulence mechanisms of this poorly understood pathogen. We will emphasize the widespread role of horizontal gene transfer in V. vulnificus specifically virulence plasmids and draw parallels from aquaculture farms to human health. By placing current findings in the context of climate change, we will also contend that fish farms act as evolutionary drivers that accelerate species evolution and the emergence of new virulent groups. Overall, we suggest that on-farm control measures should be adopted both to protect animals from Vibriosis, and also as a public health measure to prevent the emergence of new zoonotic groups.",positive,,,,
35791449,A multi-omics investigation into the mechanisms of hyper-virulence in Mycobacterium tuberculosis,"Clinical manifestations of tuberculosis range from asymptomatic infection to a life-threatening disease such as tuberculous meningitis (TBM). Recent studies showed that the spectrum of disease severity could be related to genetic diversity among clinical strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Certain strains are reported to preferentially invade the central nervous system, thus earning the label ""hypervirulent strains"".However, specific genetic mutations that accounted for enhanced mycobacterial virulence are still unknown. We previously identified a set of 17 mutations in a hypervirulent Mtb strain that was from TBM patient and exhibited significantly better intracellular survivability. These mutations were also commonly shared by a cluster of globally circulating hyper-virulent strains. Here, we aimed to validate the impact of these hypervirulent-specific mutations on the dysregulation of gene networks associated with virulence in Mtb via multi-omic analysis. We surveyed transcriptomic and proteomic differences between the hyper-virulent and low-virulent strains using RNA-sequencing and label-free quantitative LC-MS/MS approach, respectively. We identified 25 genes consistently differentially expressed between the strains at both transcript and protein level, regardless the strains were growing in a nutrient-rich or a physiologically relevant multi-stress condition (acidic pH, limited nutrients, nitrosative stress, and hypoxia). Based on integrated genomic-transcriptomic and proteomic comparisons, the hypervirulent-specific mutations in FadE5 (g. 295,746 C >T), Rv0178 (p. asp150glu), higB (p. asp30glu), and pip (IS6110-insertion) were linked to deregulated expression of the respective genes and their functionally downstream regulons. The result validated the connections between mutations, gene expression, and mycobacterial pathogenicity, and identified new possible virulence-associated pathways in Mtb.",positive,,,,
38114662,Transcription Factors Tec1 and Tec2 Play Key Roles in the Hyphal Growth and Virulence of Mucor lusitanicus Through Increased Mitochondrial Oxidative Metabolism,"Mucormycosis is a lethal and difficult-to-treat fungal infection caused by fungi of the order Mucorales. Mucor lusitanicus, a member of Mucorales, is commonly used as a model to understand disease pathogenesis. However, transcriptional control of hyphal growth and virulence in Mucorales is poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the role of Tec proteins, which belong to the TEA/ATTS transcription factor family, in the hyphal development and virulence of M. lusitanicus. Unlike in the genome of Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes, which have a single Tec homologue, in the genome of Mucorales, two Tec homologues, Tec1 and Tec2, were found, except in that of Phycomyces blakesleeanus, with only one Tec homologue. tec1 and tec2 overexpression in M. lusitanicus increased mycelial growth, mitochondrial content and activity, expression of the rhizoferrin synthetase-encoding gene rfs, and virulence in nematodes and wax moth larvae but decreased cAMP levels and protein kinase A (PKA) activity. Furthermore, tec1- and tec2-overexpressing strains required adequate mitochondrial metabolism to promote the virulent phenotype. The heterotrimeric G beta subunit 1-encoding gene deletant strain (?gpb1) increased cAMP-PKA activity, downregulation of both tec genes, decreased both virulence and hyphal development, but tec1 and tec2 overexpression restored these defects. Overexpression of allele-mutated variants of Tec1(S332A) and Tec2(S168A) in the putative phosphorylation sites for PKA increased both virulence and hyphal growth of ?gpb1. These findings suggest that Tec homologues promote mycelial development and virulence by enhancing mitochondrial metabolism and rhizoferrin accumulation, providing new information for the rational control of the virulent phenotype of M. lusitanicus.",positive,,,,
36162999,Comparative genome analysis unravels pathogenicity of Xanthomonas albilineans causing sugarcane leaf scald disease,"

Background: Xanthomonas is a genus of gram-negative bacterium containing more than 35 species. Among these pathogenic species, Xanthomonas albilineans (Xal) is of global interest, responsible for leaf scald disease in sugarcane. Another notable Xanthomonas species is Xanthomonas sachari (Xsa), a sugarcane-associated agent of chlorotic streak disease.

Result: The virulence of 24 Xanthomonas strains was evaluated by disease index (DI) and Area Under Disease Progress Curve (AUDPC) in the susceptible inoculated plants (GT 46) and clustered into three groups of five highly potent, seven mild virulent, and twelve weak virulent strains. The highly potent strain (X. albilineans, Xal JG43) and its weak virulent related strain (X. sacchari, Xsa DD13) were sequenced, assembled, and annotated in the circular genomes. The genomic size of JG43 was smaller than that of DD13. Both strains (JG43 and DD13) lacked a Type III secretory system (T3SS) and T6SS. However, JG43 possessed Salmonella pathogenicity island-1 (SPI-1). More pathogen-host interaction (PHI) genes and virulent factors in 17 genomic islands (GIs) were detected in JG43, among which six were related to pathogenicity. Albicidin and a two-component system associated with virulence were also detected in JG43. Furthermore, 23 Xanthomonas strains were sequenced and classified into three categories based on Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) mutation loci and pathogenicity, using JG43 as a reference genome. Transitions were dominant SNP mutations, while structural variation (SV) is frequent intrachromosomal rearrangement (ITX). Two essential genes (rpfC/rpfG) of the two-component system and another gene related to SNP were mutated to understand their virulence effect. The mutation of rpfG resulted in a decrease in pathogenicity.

Conclusion: These findings revealed virulence of 24 Xanthomonas strains and variations by 23 Xanthomonas strains. We sequenced, assembled, and annotated the circular genomes of Xal JG43 and Xsa DD13, identifying diversity detected by pathogenic factors and systems. Furthermore, complete genomic sequences and sequenced data will provide a theoretical basis for identifying pathogenic factors responsible for sugarcane leaf scald disease.

37364675,Akanthomyces diversity in Brazil and their pathogenicity to plant-sucking insects,"Currently, species within the genus Akanthomyces are poorly studied and explored compared to other hypocrealean entomopathogenic fungi employed as commercial biocontrol agents. This study aimed to molecularly identify 23 Brazilian Akanthomyces strains, most originally isolated from aphids and scales (n = 22), and one from the coffee leaf rust, and further investigate their pathogenicity to six plant-sucking insects as a means to better understand their host spectra. We also explored the capacity of A. muscarius CG935 for blastospore production via liquid fermentation. Akanthomyces dipterigenus, A. muscarius, A. lecanii, and two unidentified species were recognized as naturally occurring in Brazil. Akanthomyces dipterigenus CG829 and A. muscarius CG935 were highly virulent to nymphs of Bemisia tabaci (67.5-85.4% confirmed mortality) and the aphid Aphis fabae (74.6-75.3%), but only the first strain was virulent to the mealybug Planococcus sp. (80.9%). Akanthomyces lecanii CG824 was weakly virulent to all tested insects. None of the strains were pathogenic to the thrips Caliothrips phaseoli, and all strains showed low virulence to the wooly whitefly Aleurothrixus floccosus and the scale Duplachionaspis divergens. Submerged liquid fermentation yields varied from 1.72   109 (day 2) to 3.90   109 (day 5) blastospores mL-1. Blastospores or aerial conidia from A. muscarius CG935, at a single concentration of 1   107 viable propagules mL-1, resulted in 67.5-83.1% mortality of B. tabaci nymphs within 8 days post-treatment. Overall, these results encourage additional studies that could lead to the development of new mycopesticides based on Akanthomyces strains.",positive,,,,
36635489,Bacterial volatile organic compounds attenuate pathogen virulence via evolutionary trade-offs,"Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by soil bacteria have been shown to exert plant pathogen biocontrol potential owing to their strong antimicrobial activity. While the impact of VOCs on soil microbial ecology is well established, their effect on plant pathogen evolution is yet poorly understood. Here we experimentally investigated how plant-pathogenic Ralstonia solanacearum bacterium adapts to VOC-mixture produced by a biocontrol Bacillus amyloliquefaciens T-5 bacterium and how these adaptations might affect its virulence. We found that VOC selection led to a clear increase in VOC-tolerance, which was accompanied with cross-tolerance to several antibiotics commonly produced by soil bacteria. The increasing VOC-tolerance led to trade-offs with R. solanacearum virulence, resulting in almost complete loss of pathogenicity in planta. At the genetic level, these phenotypic changes were associated with parallel mutations in genes encoding lipopolysaccharide O-antigen (wecA) and type-4 pilus biosynthesis (pilM), which both have been linked with outer membrane permeability to antimicrobials and plant pathogen virulence. Reverse genetic engineering revealed that both mutations were important, with pilM having a relatively larger negative effect on the virulence, while wecA having a relatively larger effect on increased antimicrobial tolerance. Together, our results suggest that microbial VOCs are important drivers of bacterial evolution and could potentially be used in biocontrol to select for less virulent pathogens via evolutionary trade-offs.",positive,,,,
19319196,Virulent clones of Klebsiella pneumoniae: identification and evolutionary scenario based on genomic and phenotypic characterization,"Klebsiella pneumoniae is found in the environment and as a harmless commensal, but is also a frequent nosocomial pathogen (causing urinary, respiratory and blood infections) and the agent of specific human infections including Friedl nder's pneumonia, rhinoscleroma and the emerging disease pyogenic liver abscess (PLA). The identification and precise definition of virulent clones, i.e. groups of strains with a single ancestor that are associated with particular infections, is critical to understand the evolution of pathogenicity from commensalism and for a better control of infections. We analyzed 235 K. pneumoniae isolates of diverse environmental and clinical origins by multilocus sequence typing, virulence gene content, biochemical and capsular profiling and virulence to mice. Phylogenetic analysis of housekeeping genes clearly defined clones that differ sharply by their clinical source and biological features. First, two clones comprising isolates of capsular type K1, clone CC23(K1) and clone CC82(K1), were strongly associated with PLA and respiratory infection, respectively. Second, only one of the two major disclosed K2 clones was highly virulent to mice. Third, strains associated with the human infections ozena and rhinoscleroma each corresponded to one monomorphic clone. Therefore, K. pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae and K. pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis should be regarded as virulent clones derived from K. pneumoniae. The lack of strict association of virulent capsular types with clones was explained by horizontal transfer of the cps operon, responsible for the synthesis of the capsular polysaccharide. Finally, the reduction of metabolic versatility observed in clones Rhinoscleromatis, Ozaenae and CC82(K1) indicates an evolutionary process of specialization to a pathogenic lifestyle. In contrast, clone CC23(K1) remains metabolically versatile, suggesting recent acquisition of invasive potential. In conclusion, our results reveal the existence of important virulent clones associated with specific infections and provide an evolutionary framework for research into the links between clones, virulence and other genomic features in K. pneumoniae.",positive,,,,
34403565,Molecular detection and phylogenetic analysis of Marek's disease virus virulence-associated genes from vaccinated flocks in southern India reveals circulation of virulent MDV genotype,"Marek's disease (MD) is a re-emerging viral disease of chickens and a serious economic threat to the poultry industry worldwide. Continuous surveillance with molecular investigation is essential to monitor the emergence of virulent Marek's disease virus (MDV) strains and to devise any appropriate vaccination strategy and implement bio-security programmes. In the present study, we investigated the cases of MD outbreaks in vaccinated poultry flocks. The MD outbreak was confirmed through necropsy (mainly visceral tumours), histopathology and viral gene specific PCR. The pathotypes of the field MDV strains were assessed by molecular analysis of three virulence-associated genes, meq, pp38 and vIL-8. The Meq sequence of the field strains analyzed in this study lacked the 59 aa unique to mild strains, indicating that they are potentially virulent strains. Mutation at position 71 and the presence of five proline rich repeats in the transactivation domain, both associated with virulence were observed in these strains; however, the signature sequences specific to very virulent plus strains were absent. Phylogenetic analysis of meq oncogene sequences revealed clustering of the field strains with North Indian strains and with a very virulent plus ATE 2539 strain from Hungary. Analyses of pp38 protein at positions 107 and 109 and vIL-8 protein at positions 4 and 31 showed signatures of virulence. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of oncogene and virulence-associated genes of field MDVs from vaccinated flock indicated that these strains possessed molecular features of virulent strains.",positive,,,,
36670035,Recent developments in plant-downy mildew interactions,"Downy mildews are obligate oomycete pathogens that attack a wide range of plants and can cause significant economic impacts on commercial crops and ornamental plants. Traditionally, downy mildew disease control relied on an integrated strategies, that incorporate cultural practices, deployment of resistant cultivars, crop rotation, application of contact and systemic pesticides, and biopesticides. Recent advances in genomics provided data that significantly advanced understanding of downy mildew evolution, taxonomy and classification. In addition, downy mildew genomics also revealed that these obligate oomycetes have reduced numbers of virulence factor genes in comparison to hemibiotrophic and necrotrophic oomycetes. However, downy mildews do deploy significant arrays of virulence proteins, including so-called RXLR proteins that promote virulence or are recognized as avirulence factors. Pathogenomics are being applied to downy mildew population studies to determine the genetic diversity within the downy mildew populations and manage disease by selection of appropriate varieties and management strategies. Genome editing technologies have been used to manipulate host disease susceptibility genes in different plants including grapevine and sweet basil and thereby provide new soucres of resistance genes against downy mildews. Previously, it has proved difficult to transform and manipulate downy mildews because of their obligate lifestyle. However, recent exploitation of RNA interference machinery through Host-Induced Gene Silencing (HIGS) and Spray-Induced Gene Silencing (SIGS) indicate that functional genomics in downy mildews is now possible. Altogether, these breakthrough technologies and attendant fundamental understanding will advance our ability to mitigate downy mildew diseases.",positive,,,,
37147768,Comparative Characterization of Virulent and Less-Virulent Lasiodiplodia theobromae Isolates,"Lasiodiplodia theobromae attacks over 500 plant species and is an important pathogen of tropical and subtropical fruit. Due to global warming and climate change, the incidence of disease associated with L. theobromae is rising. Virulence tests performed on avocado and mango branches and fruit showed a large diversity of virulence of different L. theobromae isolates. Genome sequencing was performed for two L. theobromae isolates, representing more virulent (Avo62) and less-virulent (Man7) strains, to determine the cause of their variation. Comparative genomics, including orthologous and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analyses, identified SNPs in the less-virulent strain in genes related to secreted cell wall-degrading enzymes, stress, transporters, sucrose, and proline metabolism, genes in secondary metabolic clusters, effectors, genes involved in the cell cycle, and genes belonging to transcription factors that may contribute to the virulence of L. theobromae. Moreover, carbohydrate-active enzyme analysis revealed a minor increase in gene counts of cutinases and pectinases and the absence of a few glycoside hydrolases in the less-virulent isolate. Changes in gene-copy numbers might explain the morphological differences found in the in-vitro experiments. The more virulent Avo62 grew faster on glucose, sucrose, or starch as a single carbon source. It also grew faster under stress conditions, such as osmotic stress, alkaline pH, and relatively high temperature. Furthermore, the more virulent isolate secreted more ammonia than the less-virulent one both in vitro and in vivo. These study results describe genome-based variability related to L. theobromae virulence, which might prove useful for the mitigation of postharvest stem-end rot.",positive,,,,
35397514,Association mapping reveals a reciprocal virulence/avirulence locus within diverse US Pyrenophora teres f. maculata isolates,"

Background: Spot form net blotch (SFNB) caused by the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Pyrenophora teres f. maculata (Ptm) is an economically important disease of barley that also infects wheat. Using genetic analysis to characterize loci in Ptm genomes associated with virulence or avirulence is an important step to identify pathogen effectors that determine compatible (virulent) or incompatible (avirulent) interactions with cereal hosts. Association mapping (AM) is a powerful tool for detecting virulence loci utilizing phenotyping and genotyping data generated for natural populations of plant pathogenic fungi.

Results: Restriction-site associated DNA genotyping-by-sequencing (RAD-GBS) was used to generate 4,836 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for a natural population of 103 Ptm isolates collected from Idaho, Montana and North Dakota. Association mapping analyses were performed utilizing the genotyping and infection type data generated for each isolate when challenged on barley seedlings of thirty SFNB differential barley lines. A total of 39 marker trait associations (MTAs) were detected across the 20 barley lines corresponding to 30 quantitative trait loci (QTL); 26 novel QTL and four that were previously mapped in Ptm biparental populations. These results using diverse US isolates and barley lines showed numerous barley-Ptm genetic interactions with seven of the 30 Ptm virulence/avirulence loci falling on chromosome 3, suggesting that it is a reservoir of diverse virulence effectors. One of the loci exhibited reciprocal virulence/avirulence with one haplotype predominantly present in isolates collected from Idaho increasing virulence on barley line MXB468 and the alternative haplotype predominantly present in isolates collected from North Dakota and Montana increasing virulence on barley line CI9819.

Conclusions: Association mapping provided novel insight into the host pathogen genetic interactions occurring in the barley-Ptm pathosystem. The analysis suggests that chromosome 3 of Ptm serves as an effector reservoir in concordance with previous reports for Pyrenophora teres f. teres, the causal agent of the closely related disease net form net blotch. Additionally, these analyses identified the first reported case of a reciprocal pathogen virulence locus. However, further investigation of the pathosystem is required to determine if multiple genes or alleles of the same gene are responsible for this genetic phenomenon.

Virulence was determined based on levels of PCV-2 loads in the blood and lymph nodes and the severity of lymphoid lesion. Within the singly infected groups, PCV-2a, PCV-2b, and PCV-2d resulted in a similar virulence to each other and all were more virulent than the PCV-2e groups. Within the dually infected groups, the combination of PCV-2d and PRRSV was more virulent than the other 3 PCV-2 genotypes (2a, 2b, and 2e), each in combination with PRRSV. Both PCV-2a+PRRSV and PCV-2b+PRRSV were more virulent than PCV-2e+PRRSV in dually infected pigs. This increased virulence of PCV-2d compared to the other 3 PCV-2 genotypes (2a, 2b, and 2e) may be attributed to an extra amino acid (lysine residue) found within open reading frame 2 (ORF2) of PCV-2d. In contrast, extra amino acids in ORF2 may decrease the virulence of PCV-2e when compared to the other 3 PCV-2 genotypes (2a, 2b, and 2d). The results of this study demonstrated that PCV-2d was the most virulent PCV-2 genotype in pigs co-infected with PRRSV. The results also suggest that genetic differences in the ORF2 of PCV-2 may affect the virulence of PCV-2 genotypes.",positive,,,,
33860841,Characterization of Antibiotic Resistance and Virulence Traits Present in Clinical Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Isolates,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a notorious superbug which poses serious health threats to humanity. The severity of the infections depends on the prevalence of virulence factors and antibiotic resistance. In this study, attempts have been made to nominate the two most virulent and multidrug-resistant MRSA isolates demonstrating the preliminary features of intestinal adhesion for the futuristic applications of probiotics and postbiotics as antagonists to combat MRSA infections. In this context, six clinical isolates of MRSA were polyphasically characterized for their identity, multidrug resistance, and few selected virulence determinates such as hemolytic activity and production of coagulase, nuclease, and capsule. The gut colonizing ability of MRSA isolates was assessed by mucoadhesion, auto-aggregation, and cell surface hydrophobicity. An antibiogram of MRSA isolates suggested the resistance towards several antibiotics with multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index >0.5 (12/241, 12/206, and 5/255) as well as their genome portraying mecA mediated methicillin resistance. Besides exhibiting strong biofilm formation ability, all the isolates exhibited positive responses towards tested virulence assays coupled with their genome displaying Coa, NucA, and CapE genes. On the other hand, isolates exhibited different levels of auto-aggregation (37.90   1.8 to 51.53   3.1%) and mucin adhesion ability (68.93   0.61% to 86.62   1.96%) with a significant (P ? 0.05) variation in adhesion to different hydrocarbons.

37393040,Dengue in Bangladesh,"Dengue is one of the prominent public health concerns in tropical and subtropical regions globally. The dengue epidemic was first observed in the 1780s, mainly in Asia, Africa, and America; however, this virus was found in Bangladesh in 1964. Rapid and unplanned urbanization, global warming, and prolonged rainy season promoted dengue outbreaks in recent years in Bangladesh. Additionally, household hazards contribute to producing an increased number of Aedes mosquitoes. The presence of four subtypes of dengue viruses (DENV) intensified the dengue outbreak and fatalities, especially since the reemergence of dengue DENV 4 caused more death in 2022. Dhaka city and Rohingya refugee camps witnessed the highest prevalence of dengue patients and fatalities. Furthermore, the cocreation of the dengue outbreak and COVID-19 pandemic-related hazards overwhelmed the health system in Bangladesh. The measures previously taken by the Bangladesh government and City Corporation authorities proved inadequate to face the surge of dengue patients during the pandemic.

30815287,Importance of diagnostics in epidemic and pandemic preparedness,"Diagnostics are fundamental for successful outbreak containment. In this supplement, 'Diagnostic preparedness for WHO Blueprint pathogens', we describe specific diagnostic challenges presented by selected priority pathogens most likely to cause future epidemics. Some challenges to diagnostic preparedness are common to all outbreak situations, as highlighted by recent outbreaks of Ebola, Zika and yellow fever. In this article, we review these overarching challenges and explore potential solutions. Challenges include fragmented and unreliable funding pathways, limited access to specimens and reagents, inadequate diagnostic testing capacity at both national and community levels of healthcare and lack of incentives for companies to develop and manufacture diagnostics for priority pathogens during non-outbreak periods. Addressing these challenges in an efficient and effective way will require multiple stakeholders-public and private-coordinated in implementing a holistic approach to diagnostics preparedness. All require strengthening of healthcare system diagnostic capacity (including surveillance and education of healthcare workers), establishment of sustainable financing and market strategies and integration of diagnostics with existing mechanisms. Identifying overlaps in diagnostic development needs across different priority pathogens would allow more timely and cost-effective use of resources than a pathogen by pathogen approach; target product profiles for diagnostics should be refined accordingly. We recommend the establishment of a global forum to bring together representatives from all key stakeholders required for the response to develop a coordinated implementation plan. In addition, we should explore if and how existing mechanisms to address challenges to the vaccines sector, such as Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and Gavi, could be expanded to cover diagnostics.",positive,,,,
26033924,Ebola in Antiquity?,"This article addresses whether Ebola may have been present in an urban setting in Athens in 430 bce and explores the historical importance of the ancient outbreak. New knowledge from today's West African epidemic allows a more accurate assessment of whether Ebola may have caused the Athenian outbreak than was once possible. The Athenian disease, whose etiology remains unknown, developed abruptly with fevers, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, and hemorrhage. It originated in sub-Saharan Africa and was especially contagious to doctors and caregivers. No remedies were effective. But the few survivors who were reexposed to diseased patients were not attacked a second time, suggesting protective immunity. What lessons can we learn from the ancient outbreak that bears a clinical and epidemiologic resemblance to Ebola? The historian Thucydides, an eyewitness and disease sufferer, described how the unsuspecting city panicked as it struggled to handle the rapidly spreading, devastating disease. Moreover, he stressed a theme that has relevance today-namely, that fear and panic intensified the disruption of society and damage to the individual that was directly caused by the disease. Moreover, fear amplified the spread of disease. The destructive nature of fear has remained a signature feature of pestilences that have subsequently caught ill-prepared societies off-guard-Bubonic plague in medieval times, AIDS in the 1980s, and Ebola today. The ancient Athenian epidemic is relevant for today's West African Ebola outbreak because it shows how fear and panic can endanger the individual, our society, and our efforts to handle the disease.",positive,,,,
20087179,Epidemic viral pneumonia,"

Purpose of review: Two recent viral epidemics producing pneumonitis (severe acute respiratory syndrome and pandemic influenza A H1N1) have highlighted the potential for viral infections to cause respiratory failure with a significant risk of mortality. This review describes these epidemics and other causes of epidemic viral pneumonia.

Recent findings: The recent literature highlights the rapidity with which these emerging viral infections can be characterized and how management strategies, including supportive care, antiviral therapy and infection control precautions, can be rapidly shared and implemented.

Summary: The severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak was too short to allow management protocols to be tested in a research environment. The current 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic is fortunately not associated with as high a mortality rate as the avian influenza A (H5N1), another potential pandemic candidate virus. Prior pandemic planning as well as research planning has allowed a rapid response to this outbreak, with a significant amount of literature generated in a few months.

37721951,Nowcasting the 2022 mpox outbreak in England,"In May 2022, a cluster of mpox cases were detected in the UK that could not be traced to recent travel history from an endemic region. Over the coming months, the outbreak grew, with over 3000 total cases reported in the UK, and similar outbreaks occurring worldwide. These outbreaks appeared linked to sexual contact networks between gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, local health systems were strained, and therefore effective surveillance for mpox was essential for managing public health policy. However, the mpox outbreak in the UK was characterised by substantial delays in the reporting of the symptom onset date and specimen collection date for confirmed positive cases. These delays led to substantial backfilling in the epidemic curve, making it challenging to interpret the epidemic trajectory in real-time. Many nowcasting models exist to tackle this challenge in epidemiological data, but these lacked sufficient flexibility. We have developed a nowcasting model using generalised additive models that makes novel use of individual-level patient data to correct the mpox epidemic curve in England. The aim of this model is to correct for backfilling in the epidemic curve and provide real-time characteristics of the state of the epidemic, including the real-time growth rate. This model benefited from close collaboration with individuals involved in collecting and processing the data, enabling temporal changes in the reporting structure to be built into the model, which improved the robustness of the nowcasts generated. The resulting model accurately captured the true shape of the epidemic curve in real time.",positive,,,,
34955579,Influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the epidemiology of acute bronchiolitis,"

Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the circulation of some viruses associated with acute bronchiolitis. We analyzed the epidemiology of bronchiolitis admissions during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with 8 previous epidemic seasons.

Methods: An observational and ambispective study was performed, including infants admitted with bronchiolitis in a tertiary hospital during 2 periods: COVID-19 pandemic (15th March 2020 to 3 rd August 2021) and pre-pandemic (1st September 2012 to 14th March 2020). Demographic, clinical data and etiologies were collected.

Results: Five hundred ten patients were hospitalized with bronchiolitis: 486 in the pre-pandemic period with an average of 61 admissions per season vs. 24 during the pandemic, observing a 60.7% reduction in bronchiolitis admissions. During the pandemic, bronchiolitis outbreak was delayed until spring-summer 2021. Respiratory syncytial virus was the most frequent etiological agent in both periods.

Conclusion: We observed a change in the seasonality of bronchiolitis during the pandemic COVID-19, possibly influenced by control measures against SARS-CoV-2.

33102172,An open-source molecular diagnostic platform approach for outbreak and epidemic preparedness,"

Background: Diagnostic development for outbreak pathogens has typically followed a disease-specific reactive rather than proactive response. Given the diversity of outbreak pathogens, particularly those prioritised by the World Health Organization Research and Development Blueprint, a more flexible and proactive approach to epidemic preparedness is needed to expand access to critical molecular diagnostic tests in peripheral and resource-constrained deployment settings.

Objective: New and more sustainable directives are needed to spur the development of high-quality products, particularly for epidemics more often found in low- and middle-income countries. To leverage and de-risk the development process, we present the benefits and challenges of an open-source business model for co-development of molecular diagnostic tests for decentralised settings.

Methods: We identify key outbreak pathogens that are available only for testing in high infrastructure laboratories and compare in-country installed base platforms that could be leveraged for menu expansion. Key strengths and challenges for development are highlighted for both platform and assay developers, with discussion of how to leverage and de-risk the process through an open-source development model.

Results: Depending on the specific partner strengths, options for partnership roles are presented. The proposed open-source business model addresses the particular challenges in the detection of outbreak- and epidemic-prone pathogens in low- and middle-income countries, reduces development and deployment risks to support outbreak response, strengthens diagnostic capacity and creates a viable market for product developers.

Conclusion: We hope this model for a collaborative and open-source approach for molecular diagnostics serves to encourage stakeholders to consider co-development partnerships to improve outbreak preparedness and epidemic/pandemic response.

34834994,Interspecies Jumping of Bat Coronaviruses,"In the last two decades, several coronavirus (CoV) interspecies jumping events have occurred between bats and other animals/humans, leading to major epidemics/pandemics and high fatalities. The SARS epidemic in 2002/2003 had a ~10% fatality. The discovery of SARS-related CoVs in horseshoe bats and civets and genomic studies have confirmed bat-to-civet-to-human transmission. The MERS epidemic that emerged in 2012 had a ~35% mortality, with dromedaries as the reservoir. Although CoVs with the same genome organization (e.g., Tylonycteris BatCoV HKU4 and Pipistrellus BatCoV HKU5) were also detected in bats, there is still a phylogenetic gap between these bat CoVs and MERS-CoV. In 2016, 10 years after the discovery of Rhinolophus BatCoV HKU2 in Chinese horseshoe bats, fatal swine disease outbreaks caused by this virus were reported in southern China. In late 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia emerged in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spread globally, leading to >4,000,000 fatalities so far. Although the genome of SARS-CoV-2 is highly similar to that of SARS-CoV, patient zero and the original source of the pandemic are still unknown. To protect humans from future public health threats, measures should be taken to monitor and reduce the chance of interspecies jumping events, either occurring naturally or through recombineering experiments.",positive,,,,
27624088,Understanding Ebola: the 2014 epidemic,"Near the end of 2013, an outbreak of Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) began in Guinea, subsequently spreading to neighboring Liberia and Sierra Leone. As this epidemic grew, important public health questions emerged about how and why this outbreak was so different from previous episodes. This review provides a synthetic synopsis of the 2014-15 outbreak, with the aim of understanding its unprecedented spread. We present a summary of the history of previous epidemics, describe the structure and genetics of the ebolavirus, and review our current understanding of viral vectors and the latest treatment practices. We conclude with an analysis of the public health challenges epidemic responders faced and some of the lessons that could be applied to future outbreaks of Ebola or other viruses.",positive,,,,
25733563,"Extracting transmission networks from phylogeographic data for epidemic and endemic diseases: Ebola virus in Sierra Leone, 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza and polio in Nigeria","

Background: Phylogeography improves our understanding of spatial epidemiology. However, application to practical problems requires choices among computational tools to balance statistical rigor, computational complexity, sensitivity to sampling strategy and interpretability.

Methods: We introduce a fast, heuristic algorithm to reconstruct partially-observed transmission networks (POTN) that combines features of phylogenetic and transmission tree approaches. We compare the transmission network generated by POTN with existing algorithms (BEAST and SeqTrack), and discuss the benefits and challenges of phylogeographic analysis on examples of epidemic and endemic diseases: Ebola virus, H1N1 pandemic influenza and polio.

Results: For the 2014 Sierra Leone Ebola virus outbreak and the 2009 H1N1 outbreak, all three methods provide similarly plausible transmission histories but differ in detail. For polio in northern Nigeria, we discuss performance trade-offs between the POTN and discrete phylogeography in BEAST and conclude that spatial history reconstruction is limited by under-sampling.

Conclusions: POTN is complementary to available tools on densely-sampled data, fails gracefully on under-sampled data and is scalable to accommodate larger datasets. We provide further evidence for the utility of phylogeography for understanding transmission networks of rapidly evolving epidemics. We propose simple heuristic criteria to identify how sampling rates and disease dynamics interact to determine fundamental limitations of phylogeographic inference.

34655396,An Insight Into Detection Pathways/Biosensors of Highly Infectious Coronaviruses,"The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences have inflicted a substantial damage on the world. In this study, it was attempted to review the recent coronaviruses appeared among the human being and their epidemic/pandemic spread throughout the world. Currently, there is an inevitable need for the establishment of a quick and easily available biosensor for tracing COVID-19 in all countries. It has been known that the incubation time of COVID-19 lasts about 14 days and 25% of the infected individuals are asymptomatic. To improve the ability to determine SARS-CoV-2 precisely and reduce the risk of eliciting false-negative results produced by mutating nature of coronaviruses, many researchers have established a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay using mismatch-tolerant molecular beacons as multiplex real-time RT-PCR to distinguish between pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains of coronaviruses. The possible mechanisms and pathways for the detection of coronaviruses by biosensors have been reviewed in this study.",positive,,,,

HRV is less frequently implicated in the development of severe respiratory infections. This study reports a nosocomial outbreak of bronchitis and pneumonia caused by HRV in a hospital during the COVID-19 epidemic in September 2022 in Gunma Prefecture, Japan. The patient continued to be symptomatic for nine days. During this outbreak, all 15 residents displayed respiratory symptoms. HRV-A was detected in 12 of the 12 samples, and phylogenetic analysis classified the strain as HRV-A type 61. HRV, COVID-19, and other respiratory infections cannot be differentiated based solely on clinical symptoms. A surveillance system to monitor them is thus needed.",positive,,,,
16422180,Avian influenza,"Influenza is an old disease but remains vital nowadays. Three types of influenza viruses, namely A, B, C, have been identified; among them influenza A virus has pandemic potential. The first outbreak of human illness due to avian influenza virus (H5N1) occurred in 1997 in Hong Kong with a mortality of 30%. The most recent outbreak of the avian influenza epidemic has been going on in Asian countries since 2003. As of March 2005, 44 incidental human infections and 32 deaths have been documented. Human influenza viruses differ with other avian influenza viruses on the choice of cellular receptors. Avian influenza viruses bind to cell-surface glycoproteins or glycolipids containing terminal sialyl-galactosyl residues linked by 2-3-linkage [Neu5Ac(alpha2-3)Gal], whereas human viruses, including the earliest available isolates from the 1957 and 1968 pandemics, bind to receptors that contain terminal 2-6-linked sialyl-galactosyl moieties [Neu5Ac(alpha2-6)Gal]. Recent evidence suggests that human bronchial ciliated epithelial cells contain Neu5Ac(alpha2-3)Gal and can be infected with avian influenza viruses. Nevertheless, avian influenza viruses can not infect non-ciliated bronchial epithelial cells. Hence, adaptation of the avian influenza virus to nonciliated cells is a prerequisite for a pandemic virus to emerge. Biological behaviors of influenza viruses indicate that once a pandemic virus emerges, isolation is not likely to contain this epidemic. A specific vaccine against the pandemic strain will not be available until 6 to 12 months after the inception of the pandemic. Judicious use of antiviral agents and stringent disease control measures are imperative to decrease the impact of a future pandemic.",positive,,,,

Monkeypox is an acute rash zoonosis caused by the monkeypox virus, which was previously concentrated in Africa. The re-emergence of this pathogen seems unusual on account of outbreaks in multiple nonendemic countries and the incline to spread from person to person. We need to revisit this virus to prevent the epidemic from getting worse. In this review, we comprehensively summarize studies on monkeypox, including its epidemiology, biological characteristics, pathogenesis, and clinical characteristics, as well as therapeutics and vaccines, highlighting its unusual outbreak attributed to the transformation of transmission. We also analyze the present situation and put forward countermeasures from both clinical and scientific research to address it. ",positive,,,,

An outbreak investigation implicated measles and streptococcal co-infections in most deaths, and also characterised a parallel epidemic of primary streptococcal pneumonia in soldiers without measles. For the first time, the natural history and pathogenesis of these diseases was able to be well characterised by a broad-interdisciplinary research effort with hundreds of military and civilian physicians and scientists representing disciplines such as internal medicine, pathology, microbiology, radiology, surgery, preventive medicine, and rehabilitation medicine. A clear conceptualisation of bronchopneumonia resulting from viral-bacterial interactions between pathogens was developed, and prevention and treatment approaches were developed and optimised in real time. These approaches were used in the 1918 influenza pandemic, which began as the measles epidemic waned. The outbreak findings remain relevant to the understanding and medical management of severe pneumonia.",positive,,,,
38054533,Exploring the dynamics of the 2022 mpox outbreak in Canada,"The 2022 mpox outbreak predominantly impacted gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (gbMSM). Two models were developed to support situational awareness and management decisions in Canada. A compartmental model characterized epidemic drivers at national/provincial levels, while an agent-based model (ABM) assessed municipal-level impacts of vaccination. The models were parameterized and calibrated using empirical case and vaccination data between 2022 and 2023. The compartmental model explored: (1) the epidemic trajectory through community transmission, (2) the potential for transmission among non-gbMSM, and (3) impacts of vaccination and the proportion of gbMSM contributing to disease transmission. The ABM incorporated sexual-contact data and modeled: (1) effects of vaccine uptake on disease dynamics, and (2) impacts of case importation on outbreak resurgence. The calibrated, compartmental model followed the trajectory of the epidemic, which peaked in July 2022, and died out in December 2022. Most cases occurred among gbMSM, and epidemic trajectories were not consistent with sustained transmission among non-gbMSM. The ABM suggested that unprioritized vaccination strategies could increase the outbreak size by 47%, and that consistent importation (?5 cases per 10 000) is necessary for outbreak resurgence. These models can inform time-sensitive situational awareness and policy decisions for similar future outbreaks. ",positive,,,,

Kuwait reported its first imported cases of COVID-19 on February 24, 2020. Analysis of data from the first three months of community transmission of the COVID-19 outbreak in Kuwait can provide important guidance for decision-making when dealing with future SARS-CoV-2 epidemic wave management. The analysis of intervention scenarios can help to evaluate the possible impacts of various outbreak control measures going forward which aim to reduce the effective reproduction number during the initial outbreak wave. Herein we use a modified susceptible-exposed-asymptomatic-infectious-removed (SEAIR) transmission model to estimate the outbreak dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Kuwait. We fit case data from the first 96 days in the model to estimate the effective reproduction number and used Google mobility data to refine community contact matrices. The SEAIR modelled scenarios allow for the analysis of various interventions to determine their effectiveness. The model can help inform future pandemic wave management, not only in Kuwait but for other countries as well.",positive,,,,
39305919,Antimicrobial resistance: a concise update,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a serious threat to global public health, with approximately 5 million deaths associated with bacterial AMR in 2019.

34225545,Antimicrobial resistance in low- and middle-income countries: current status and future directions,"

Introduction: Rising rates of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) globally continue to pose agrave threat to human health. Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are disproportionately affected, partly due to the high burden of communicable diseases.

Areas covered: We reviewed current trends in AMR in LMICs and examined the forces driving AMR in those regions. The state of interventions being undertaken to curb AMR across the developing world are discussed, and the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic on those efforts is explored.

Expert opinion: The dynamics that drive AMR in LMICs are inseparable from the political, economic, socio-cultural, and environmental forces that shape these nations. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated underlying factors that increase AMR. Some progress is being made in implementing surveillance measures in LMICs, but implementation of concrete measures to meaningfully impact AMR rates must address the underlying structural issues that generate and promote AMR. This, in turn, will require large infrastructural investments and significant political will.

28492988,The Threat of Antimicrobial Resistance on the Human Microbiome,"Ubiquitous in nature, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has existed long before the golden age of antimicrobials. While antimicrobial agents are beneficial to combat infection, their widespread use contributes to the increase in and emergence of novel resistant microbes in virtually all environmental niches. The human microbiome is an important reservoir of AMR with initial exposure occurring in early life. Once seeded with AMR, commensal organisms may be key contributors to the dissemination of resistance due to the interconnectedness of microbial communities. When acquired by pathogens however, AMR becomes a serious public health threat worldwide. Our ability to combat the threat of emerging resistance relies on accurate AMR detection methods and the development of therapeutics that function despite the presence of antimicrobial resistance.",positive,,,,
37749210,Genomic surveillance for antimicrobial resistance - a One Health perspective ,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) - the ability of microorganisms to adapt and survive under diverse chemical selection pressures - is influenced by complex interactions between humans, companion and food-producing animals, wildlife, insects and the environment. To understand and manage the threat posed to health (human, animal, plant and environmental) and security (food and water security and biosecurity), a multifaceted 'One Health' approach to AMR surveillance is required. Genomic technologies have enabled monitoring of the mobilization, persistence and abundance of AMR genes and mutations within and between microbial populations. Their adoption has also allowed source-tracing of AMR pathogens and modelling of AMR evolution and transmission.

30850636,Global monitoring of antimicrobial resistance based on metagenomics analyses of urban sewage,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a serious threat to global public health, but obtaining representative data on AMR for healthy human populations is difficult. Here, we use metagenomic analysis of untreated sewage to characterize the bacterial resistome from 79 sites in 60 countries. We find systematic differences in abundance and diversity of AMR genes between Europe/North-America/Oceania and Africa/Asia/South-America. Antimicrobial use data and bacterial taxonomy only explains a minor part of the AMR variation that we observe. We find no evidence for cross-selection between antimicrobial classes, or for effect of air travel between sites. However, AMR gene abundance strongly correlates with socio-economic, health and environmental factors, which we use to predict AMR gene abundances in all countries in the world. Our findings suggest that global AMR gene diversity and abundance vary by region, and that improving sanitation and health could potentially limit the global burden of AMR. We propose metagenomic analysis of sewage as an ethically acceptable and economically feasible approach for continuous global surveillance and prediction of AMR.",positive,,,,
38501800,The European livestock resistome,"Metagenomic sequencing has proven to be a powerful tool in the monitoring of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Here, we provide a comparative analysis of the resistome from pigs, poultry, veal calves, turkey, and rainbow trout, for a total of 538 herds across nine European countries. We calculated the effects of per-farm management practices and antimicrobial usage (AMU) on the resistome in pigs, broilers, and veal calves. We also provide an in-depth study of the associations between bacterial diversity, resistome diversity, and AMR abundances as well as co-occurrence analysis of bacterial taxa and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and the universality of the latter. The resistomes of veal calves and pigs clustered together, as did those of avian origin, while the rainbow trout resistome was different. Moreover, we identified clear core resistomes for each specific food-producing animal species. We identified positive associations between bacterial alpha diversity and both resistome alpha diversity and abundance. Network analyses revealed very few taxa-ARG associations in pigs but a large number for the avian species. Using updated reference databases and optimized bioinformatics, previously reported significant associations between AMU, biosecurity, and AMR in pig and poultry farms were validated. AMU is an important driver for AMR; however, our integrated analyses suggest that factors contributing to increased bacterial diversity might also be associated with higher AMR load. We also found that dispersal limitations of ARGs are shaping livestock resistomes, and future efforts to fight AMR should continue to emphasize biosecurity measures.IMPORTANCEUnderstanding the occurrence, diversity, and drivers for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is important to focus future control efforts. So far, almost all attempts to limit AMR in livestock have addressed antimicrobial consumption. We here performed an integrated analysis of the resistomes of five important farmed animal populations across Europe finding that the resistome and AMR levels are also shaped by factors related to bacterial diversity, as well as dispersal limitations. Thus, future studies and interventions aimed at reducing AMR should not only address antimicrobial usage but also consider other epidemiological and ecological factors.",positive,,,,

The study was done in eight provinces in Indonesia and included reviewing AMR-related policy, collecting antibiotic use reports in primary health care from health offices and hospitals, and conducting in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with informants from health and nonhealth sectors. The results of the study show that AM misuse happens not only in healthcare facilities but also in communities.

27654605,Antimicrobial Resistance,"

Importance: The development of antibiotics is considered among the most important advances of modern science. Antibiotics have saved millions of lives. However, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) threatens this progress and presents significant risks to human health.

Objective: To identify factors associated with AMR, the current epidemiology of important resistant organisms, and possible solutions to the AMR problem.

Data sources, study selection, and data synthesis: PubMed (2000-2016), NIH REPORTER, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched for articles and entries related to AMR, focusing on epidemiology, clinical effects of AMR, discovery of novel agents to treat AMR bacterial infections, and nonpharmacological strategies to eliminate or modify AMR bacteria. In addition to articles and entries found in these databases, selected health policy reports and public health guidance documents were reviewed. Of 217 articles, databases, and reports identified, 103 were selected for review.

Results: The increase in AMR has been driven by a diverse set of factors, including inappropriate antibiotic prescribing and sales, use of antibiotics outside of the health care sector, and genetic factors intrinsic to bacteria. The problem has been exacerbated by inadequate economic incentives for pharmaceutical development of new antimicrobial agents. A range of specific AMR concerns, including carbapenem- and colistin-resistant gram-negative organisms, pose a clinical challenge. Alternative approaches to address the AMR threat include new methods of antibacterial drug identification and strategies that neutralize virulence factors.

Conclusions and relevance: Antimicrobial resistance poses significant challenges for current clinical care. Modified use of antimicrobial agents and public health interventions, coupled with novel antimicrobial strategies, may help mitigate the effect of multidrug-resistant organisms in the future.

This study reviewed global guidance and 25 National Action Plans to evaluate thematic priorities in One Health AMR approaches using a novel framework that additionally facilitated the identification of water-related stewardship gaps, as water resources are recognized as the primary environmental AMR reservoir and dissemination pathway. This review found that global and national stewardship primarily focuses on mitigating antibiotic use in the human and animal sectors, overlooking environmental drivers, particularly diverse environmental waters. The findings of this study highlight the need to broaden the scope of water-related AMR concerns beyond water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure for water supply and wastewater treatment, and account for environmental waters in AMR development and dissemination, particularly in low-income countries where half a billion people rely on environmental waters to meet daily needs.

39327564,Using priorities between human and livestock bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to identify data gaps in livestock AMR surveillance,"

Background: Bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global threat to both humans and livestock. Despite this, there is limited global consensus on data-informed, priority areas for intervention in both sectors. We compare current livestock AMR data collection efforts with other variables pertinent to human and livestock AMR to identify critical data gaps and mutual priorities.

Methods: We globally synthesized livestock AMR data from open-source surveillance reports and point prevalence surveys stratified for six pathogens (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, non-typhoidal Salmonella, Campylobacter spp., Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium) and eleven antimicrobial classes important in human and veterinary use, published between 2000 and 2020. We also included all livestock species represented in the data: cattle, chickens, pigs, sheep, turkeys, ducks, horses, buffaloes, and goats. We compared this data with intended priorities calculated from: disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), livestock antimicrobial usage (AMU), livestock biomass, and a global correlation exercise between livestock and human proportion of resistant isolates.

Results: Resistance to fluoroquinolones and macrolides in Staphylococcus aureus were identified as priorities in many countries but, less than 10% of these reported livestock AMR data. Resistance data for Escherichia coli specific to cattle, chickens, and pigs, which we prioritized, were also well collected. AMR data collection on non-typhoidal Salmonella and other livestock species were often not prioritized. Of 232 categories prioritized by at least one country, data were only collected for 48% (n = 112).

Conclusions: The lack of livestock AMR data globally for broad resistance in Staphylococcus aureus could underplay their zoonotic threat. Countries can bolster livestock AMR data collection, reporting, and intervention setting for Staphylococcus aureus as done for Escherichia coli. This framework can provide guidance on areas to strengthen AMR surveillance and decision-making for humans and livestock, and if done routinely, can adapt to resistance trends and priorities.

35223919,Proteomic Signatures of Antimicrobial Resistance in Yersinia pestis and Francisella tularensis,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a well-recognized, widespread, and growing issue of concern. With increasing incidence of AMR, the ability to respond quickly to infection with or exposure to an AMR pathogen is critical. Approaches that could accurately and more quickly identify whether a pathogen is AMR also are needed to more rapidly respond to existing and emerging biological threats. We examined proteins associated with paired AMR and antimicrobial susceptible (AMS) strains of Yersinia pestis and Francisella tularensis, causative agents of the diseases plague and tularemia, respectively, to identify whether potential existed to use proteins as signatures of AMR. We found that protein expression was significantly impacted by AMR status. Antimicrobial resistance-conferring proteins were expressed even in the absence of antibiotics in growth media, and the abundance of 10-20% of cellular proteins beyond those that directly confer AMR also were significantly changed in both Y. pestis and F. tularensis. Most strikingly, the abundance of proteins involved in specific metabolic pathways and biological functions was altered in all AMR strains examined, independent of species, resistance mechanism, and affected cellular antimicrobial target. We have identified features that distinguish between AMR and AMS strains, including a subset of features shared across species with different resistance mechanisms, which suggest shared biological signatures of resistance. These features could form the basis of novel approaches to identify AMR phenotypes in unknown strains.",positive,,,,

In the battle against AMR, it is crucial to recognize the impacts of all four domains, namely, mankind, livestock, agriculture, and the ecosystem. Many sociocultural and financial practices that are widespread in the world have made resistance management extremely complicated. Several pathways, including hospital effluent, agricultural waste, and wastewater treatment facilities, have been identified as potential routes for the spread of resistant bacteria and their resistance genes in soil and surrounding ecosystems. The overuse of uncontrolled antibiotics and improper treatment and recycled wastewater are among the contributors to AMR. Health-care organizations have begun to address AMR, although they are currently in the early stages. In this review, we provide a brief overview of AMR development processes, the worldwide burden and drivers of AMR, current knowledge gaps, monitoring methodologies, and global mitigation measures in the development and spread of AMR in the environment.

35763683,Measures Against Antimicrobial Resistance in Children in Japan: Current Status and Future Prospects,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major problem in public health. Japan is addressing this problem with various measures based on the National Action Plan on AMR, published in 2016. In Japan, the fight against AMR is hindered by issues with the health care system, including the lack of a general practitioner registration system, an abundance of private clinics and health care for infants and toddlers being essentially free of charge. As measures against AMR in inpatient care, thorough infection prevention and the Japanese government's incentivization of collaboration in infection prevention among hospitals and regions have helped to improve infection prevention. As measures against AMR in outpatient care, the creation of official Japanese government guidelines on antimicrobial stewardship has facilitated the implementation of antimicrobial stewardship in clinics. Another unique measure taken in Japan is incentivizing the nonprescription of antimicrobials for respiratory tract infections and diarrhea. Although Asia is a hot spot for AMR bacteria, the fight against AMR is affected by various factors, including insufficient precautions against nosocomial infections and the absence of surveillance systems. To combat these problems, Japan must take a strong leadership role. AMR is a problem not only at the level of individual countries but on a global scale and should, therefore, be addressed through joint action among nations. ",positive,,,,
38976935,Intrinsic antimicrobial resistance: Molecular biomaterials to combat microbial biofilms and bacterial persisters,"The escalating rise in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) coupled with a declining arsenal of new antibiotics is imposing serious threats to global public health. A pervasive aspect of many acquired AMR infections is that the pathogenic microorganisms exist as biofilms, which are equipped with superior survival strategies. In addition, persistent and recalcitrant infections are seeded with bacterial persister cells at infection sites. Together, conventional antibiotic therapeutics often fail in the complete treatment of infections associated with bacterial persisters and biofilms. Novel therapeutics have been attempted to tackle AMR, biofilms, and persister-associated complex infections. This review focuses on the progress in designing molecular biomaterials and therapeutics to address acquired and intrinsic AMR, and the fundamental microbiology behind biofilms and persisters. Starting with a brief introduction of AMR basics and approaches to tackling acquired AMR, the emphasis is placed on various biomaterial approaches to combating intrinsic AMR, including (1) semi-synthetic antibiotics; (2) macromolecular or polymeric biomaterials mimicking antimicrobial peptides; (3) adjuvant effects in synergy; (4) nano-therapeutics; (5) nitric oxide-releasing antimicrobials; (6) antimicrobial hydrogels; (7) antimicrobial coatings. Particularly, the structure-activity relationship is elucidated in each category of these biomaterials. Finally, illuminating perspectives are provided for the future design of molecular biomaterials to bypass AMR and cure chronic multi-drug resistant (MDR) infections.",positive,,,,
29665886,Antimicrobial resistance: from basic science to translational innovation,"The rise in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a major threat to animal agriculture and human health. To summarize and update current and emerging AMR issues that are significant for animal health and food safety, this issue presents a virtual AMR symposium consisting of seven review papers. These reviews cover a newly described AMR mechanism in Campylobacter, effects of AMR and microbiome on Campylobacter infection, plasmid-mediated colistin resistance in food-producing animals, the impact of point source or antibiotic residues on the environmental resistome, and potential factors influencing horizontal gene transfer in the intestines of food animals. These papers also identify significant knowledge gaps in AMR research and provide new directions for the development of innovative and effective strategies to mitigate AMR in the animal production system.",positive,,,,
37365851,Cyanobacteria as a critical reservoir of the environmental antimicrobial resistome,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is predicted to cause a worldwide annual toll of 10 million deaths by 2050. This looming public health threat has been linked to antibiotic overuse and pollution, which places selective pressures on AMR maintenance and transfer in and between microbial populations. We examined the distribution, diversity and potential mobility of AMR genes in cyanobacteria. While cyanobacteria are not pathogenic, we hypothesised that they could be a major environmental reservoir for AMR genes. Genes encoding AMR to seven antimicrobial drug classes were found in 10% of cyanobacterial genomes. AMR genes were found in 13% of freshwater, 19% of terrestrial, 34% of symbiotic, 2% of thermal spring, and 3% of marine genomes. AMR genes were found in five cyanobacterial orders with 23% of Nostocales and 8% of Oscillatoriales strains containing AMR genes. The most frequently observed alleles were ansamycin resistance genes, which were present in 7% of strains. AMR genes responsible for resistance to broad-spectrum ?-lactams, chloramphenicols, tetracyclines, macrolides, and aminoglycosides were associated with mobile genetic elements or plasmid replicons or both. These results suggest that cyanobacteria are an extensive reservoir, and potential vector, for AMR genes in diverse terrestrial and aquatic habitats.",positive,,,,
34439041,Framing the Drivers of Antimicrobial Resistance in Tanzania,"Despite global awareness of the key factors surrounding antimicrobial resistance (AMR), designing and implementing policies to address the critical issues around the drivers of AMR remains complex to put into practice. We identified prevalent narratives and framing used by epistemological communities involved in the response to AMR in Tanzania, interrogated how this framing may inform policymaking, and identified interventions that could be tailored to the groups believed responsible for AMR. We interviewed 114 key informants from three districts and analysed transcripts line by line. Our results suggest that many different groups help drive the spread of AMR in Tanzania and need to be involved in any effective response. Human health is currently perceived as driving the response, while other domains lag behind in their efforts. For AMR programmes to be successful, all sectors need to be involved, including civil society groups, community representatives, and those working in communities (e.g., primary care physicians). However, current plans and programmes largely fail to include these viewpoints. The perceived presence of political will in Tanzania is a significant step towards such a response. Any strategies to tackle AMR need to be tailored to the context-specific realities, taking into account constraints, beliefs, and power dynamics within countries. ",positive,,,,
34267046,Antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in international travelers,"

Purpose of review: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in bacteria poses a major risk to global public health, with many factors contributing to the observed increase in AMR. International travel is one recognized contributor. The purpose of this review is to summarize current knowledge regarding the acquisition, carriage and spread of AMR bacteria by international travelers.

Recent findings: Recent studies have highlighted that travel is an important risk factor for the acquisition of AMR bacteria, with approximately 30% of studied travelers returning with an acquired AMR bacterium. Epidemiological studies have shown there are three major risk factors for acquisition: travel destination, antimicrobial usage and travelers' diarrhea (TD). Analyses have begun to illustrate the AMR genes that are acquired and spread by travelers, risk factors for acquisition and carriage of AMR bacteria, and local transmission of imported AMR organisms.

Summary: International travel is a contributor to the acquisition and dissemination of AMR organisms globally. Efforts to reduce the burden of AMR organisms should include a focus on international travelers. Routine genomic surveillance would further elucidate the role of international travel in the global spread of AMR bacteria.

28220145,Where Sepsis and Antimicrobial Resistance Countermeasures Converge,"The United Nations General Assembly debate on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) recognizes the global significance of AMR. Much work needs to be done on technology capability and capacity to convert the strategic intent of the debate into operational plans and tangible outcomes. Enhancement of the biomedical science-clinician interface requires better exploitation of systems biology tools for in-laboratory and point of care methods that detect sepsis and characterize AMR. These need to link sepsis and AMR data with responsive, real-time surveillance. We propose an AMR sepsis register, similar in concept to a cancer registry, to aid coordination of AMR countermeasures.",positive,,,,
33198604,The values and principles underpinning community engagement approaches to tackling antimicrobial resistance (AMR),"This paper presents seven values underpinning the application of Community Engagement (CE) approaches to the One Health challenge of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) developed during an international workshop in June 2019. We define a value as a quality or standard which a CE project is aiming for, whilst a principle is an objective which underpins the value and facilitates its achievement. The values of Clarity, Creativity, (being) Evidence-led, Equity, Interdisciplinarity, Sustainability and Flexibility were identified by a network of 40 researchers and practitioners who utilise CE approaches to tackle complex One Health challenges including, but not limited to, AMR. We present our understanding of these seven values and their underlying principles as a flexible tool designed to support stakeholders within CE for AMR projects. We include practical guidance on working toward each value, plus case studies of the values in action within existing AMR interventions. Finally, we consider the extent to which CE approaches are appropriate to tackle AMR challenges. We reflect on these in relation to the tool, and current literature for both CE and AMR research. Authors and co-producers anticipate this tool being used to scene-set, road map and trouble shoot the development, implementation, and evaluation of CE projects to address AMR and other One Health challenges. However, the tool is not prescriptive but responsive to the context and needs of the community, opening opportunity to build a truly collaborative and community-centred approach to AMR research.",positive,,,,
35428201,Enhancing predictions of antimicrobial resistance of pathogens by expanding the potential resistance gene repertoire using a pan-genome-based feature selection approach,"

Background: Predicting which pathogens might exhibit antimicrobial resistance (AMR) based on genomics data is one of the promising ways to swiftly and precisely identify AMR pathogens. Currently, the most widely used genomics approach is through identifying known AMR genes from genomic information in order to predict whether a pathogen might be resistant to certain antibiotic drugs. The list of known AMR genes, however, is still far from comprehensive and may result in inaccurate AMR pathogen predictions. We thus felt the need to expand the AMR gene set and proposed a pan-genome-based feature selection method to identify potential gene sets for AMR prediction purposes.

Results: By building pan-genome datasets and extracting gene presence/absence patterns from four bacterial species, each with more than 2000 strains, we showed that machine learning models built from pan-genome data can be very promising for predicting AMR pathogens. The gene set selected by the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) feature selection approach further improved prediction outcomes, and an incremental approach selecting subsets of XGBoost-selected features brought the machine learning model performance to the next level. Investigating selected gene sets revealed that on average about 50% of genes had no known function and very few of them were known AMR genes, indicating the potential of the selected gene sets to expand resistance gene repertoires.

Conclusions: We demonstrated that a pan-genome-based feature selection approach is suitable for building machine learning models for predicting AMR pathogens. The extracted gene sets may provide future clues to expand our knowledge of known AMR genes and provide novel hypotheses for inferring bacterial AMR mechanisms.

30194944,Antimicrobial resistance plasmid reservoir in food and food-producing animals,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) plasmids have been recognized as important vectors for efficient spread of AMR phenotypes. The food reservoir includes both food-producing animals and food products, and a huge diversity of AMR plasmids have been reported in this sector. Based on molecular typing methods and/or whole genome sequencing approaches, certain AMR genes/plasmids combinations were found more frequently in food compared to other settings. However, the food source of a definite AMR plasmid is highly complex to confirm due to cross-sectorial transfers and international spread of AMR plasmids. For risk assessment purposes related to human health, AMR plasmids found in food and bearing genes conferring resistances to critically important antibiotics in human medicine - such as to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, carbapenems or colistin - have been under specific scrutiny these last years. Those plasmids are often multidrug resistant and their dissemination can be driven by the selective pressure exerted by any of the antibiotics concerned. Also, AMR plasmids carry numerous other genes conferring vital properties to the bacterial cell and are recurrently subjected to evolutionary steps such as hybrid plasmids, making the epidemiology of AMR plasmids in food a moving picture.",positive,,,,
37285914,Contribution of wastewater to antimicrobial resistance: A review article,"

Objectives: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global challenge that has raised concern globally, owing to its detrimental effects on the health and economy of countries. The ever-growing threat of AMR and sources of AMR are still being investigated. Wastewater plays an important role as a habitat for bacteria and an environment conducive to gene transfer. The primary aim of this review was to highlight the contribution of wastewater to AMR.

Methods: Evidence of AMR in wastewater was drawn from literature published in the last 10 years, from 2012 to 2022.

Results: Wastewater from agricultural practices, pharmaceutical manufacturing plants, and hospital effluents was established to promote AMR. Furthermore, stress factors such as the presence of antibiotics, heavy metals, pH, and temperature initiate and propagate AMR in bacteria living in wastewater. AMR in bacteria from wastewater was established to be either natural or acquired. Wastewater treatment techniques such as membrane filtration, coagulation, adsorption, and advanced oxidation processes have been used to remove resistant bacteria with varying success levels.

Conclusion: Wastewater is a major contributor to AMR, and an understanding of its role in AMR is necessary to find a lasting solution. In this regard, the spread of AMR in wastewater should be considered a threat that requires a strategy to stop further damage.

29654279,Horizontal antimicrobial resistance transfer drives epidemics of multiple Shigella species,"Horizontal gene transfer has played a role in developing the global public health crisis of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). However, the dynamics of AMR transfer through bacterial populations and its direct impact on human disease is poorly elucidated. Here, we study parallel epidemic emergences of multiple Shigella species, a priority AMR organism, in men who have sex with men to gain insight into AMR emergence and spread. Using genomic epidemiology, we show that repeated horizontal transfer of a single AMR plasmid among Shigella enhanced existing and facilitated new epidemics. These epidemic patterns contrasted with slighter, slower increases in disease caused by organisms with vertically inherited (chromosomally encoded) AMR. This demonstrates that horizontal transfer of AMR directly affects epidemiological outcomes of globally important AMR pathogens and highlights the need for integration of genomic analyses into all areas of AMR research, surveillance and management.",positive,,,,

The programme's core campaign is to stop producing AMR by promoting responsible use of antibiotics, and to stop the acquisition and transmission of AMR by promoting good sanitation and hygiene as well as compliance with infection control and prevention practices.",positive,,,,
37030292,Discovery of phage determinants that confer sensitivity to bacterial immune systems,"Over the past few years, numerous anti-phage defense systems have been discovered in bacteria. Although the mechanism of defense for some of these systems is understood, a major unanswered question is how these systems sense phage infection. To systematically address this question, we isolated 177 phage mutants that escape 15 different defense systems. In many cases, these escaper phages were mutated in the gene sensed by the defense system, enabling us to map the phage determinants that confer sensitivity to bacterial immunity. Our data identify specificity determinants of diverse retron systems and reveal phage-encoded triggers for multiple abortive infection systems. We find general themes in phage sensing and demonstrate that mechanistically diverse systems have converged to sense either the core replication machinery of the phage, phage structural components, or host takeover mechanisms. Combining our data with previous findings, we formulate key principles on how bacterial immune systems sense phage invaders.",positive,,,,

30763536,Phage Therapy: A Renewed Approach to Combat Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria,"Phage therapy, long overshadowed by chemical antibiotics, is garnering renewed interest in Western medicine. This stems from the rise in frequency of multi-drug-resistant bacterial infections in humans. There also have been recent case reports of phage therapy demonstrating clinical utility in resolving these otherwise intractable infections. Nevertheless, bacteria can readily evolve phage resistance too, making it crucial for modern phage therapy to develop strategies to capitalize on this inevitability. Here, we review the history of phage therapy research. We compare and contrast phage therapy and chemical antibiotics, highlighting their potential synergies when used in combination. We also examine the use of animal models, case studies, and results from clinical trials. Throughout, we explore how the modern scientific community works to improve the reliability and success of phage therapy in the clinic and discuss how to properly evaluate the potential for phage therapy to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria.",positive,,,,
25131402,Bacteria-phage interactions in natural environments,"Phages are considered the most abundant and diverse biological entities on Earth and are notable not only for their sheer abundance, but also for their influence on bacterial hosts. In nature, bacteria-phage relationships are complex and have far-reaching consequences beyond particular pairwise interactions, influencing everything from bacterial virulence to eukaryotic fitness to the carbon cycle. In this review, we examine bacteria and phage distributions in nature first by highlighting biogeographic patterns and nonhost environmental influences on phage distribution, then by considering the ways in which phages and bacteria interact, emphasizing phage life cycles, bacterial responses to phage infection, and the complex patterns of phage host specificity. Finally, we discuss phage impacts on bacterial abundance, genetics, and physiology, and further aim to clarify distinctions between current theoretical models and point out areas in need of future research.

26755501,Host receptors for bacteriophage adsorption,"The adsorption of bacteriophages (phages) onto host cells is, in all but a few rare cases, a sine qua non condition for the onset of the infection process. Understanding the mechanisms involved and the factors affecting it is, thus, crucial for the investigation of host-phage interactions. This review provides a survey of the phage host receptors involved in recognition and adsorption and their interactions during attachment. Comprehension of the whole infection process, starting with the adsorption step, can enable and accelerate our understanding of phage ecology and the development of phage-based technologies. To assist in this effort, we have established an open-access resource--the Phage Receptor Database (PhReD)--to serve as a repository for information on known and newly identified phage receptors.

28688779,"Formulation, stabilisation and encapsulation of bacteriophage for phage therapy","Against a backdrop of global antibiotic resistance and increasing awareness of the importance of the human microbiota, there has been resurgent interest in the potential use of bacteriophages for therapeutic purposes, known as phage therapy. A number of phage therapy phase I and II clinical trials have concluded, and shown phages don't present significant adverse safety concerns. These clinical trials used simple phage suspensions without any formulation and phage stability was of secondary concern. Phages have a limited stability in solution, and undergo a significant drop in phage titre during processing and storage which is unacceptable if phages are to become regulated pharmaceuticals, where stable dosage and well defined pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are de rigueur. Animal studies have shown that the efficacy of phage therapy outcomes depend on the phage concentration (i.e. the dose) delivered at the site of infection, and their ability to target and kill bacteria, arresting bacterial growth and clearing the infection. In addition, in vitro and animal studies have shown the importance of using phage cocktails rather than single phage preparations to achieve better therapy outcomes. The in vivo reduction of phage concentration due to interactions with host antibodies or other clearance mechanisms may necessitate repeated dosing of phages, or sustained release approaches. Modelling of phage-bacterium population dynamics reinforces these points. Surprisingly little attention has been devoted to the effect of formulation on phage therapy outcomes, given the need for phage cocktails, where each phage within a cocktail may require significantly different formulation to retain a high enough infective dose. This review firstly looks at the clinical needs and challenges (informed through a review of key animal studies evaluating phage therapy) associated with treatment of acute and chronic infections and the drivers for phage encapsulation. An important driver for formulation and encapsulation is shelf life and storage of phage to ensure reproducible dosages. Other drivers include formulation of phage for encapsulation in micro- and nanoparticles for effective delivery, encapsulation in stimuli responsive systems for triggered controlled or sustained release at the targeted site of infection. Encapsulation of phage (e.g. in liposomes) may also be used to increase the circulation time of phage for treating systemic infections, for prophylactic treatment or to treat intracellular infections. We then proceed to document approaches used in the published literature on the formulation and stabilisation of phage for storage and encapsulation of bacteriophage in micro- and nanostructured materials using freeze drying (lyophilization), spray drying, in emulsions e.g. ointments, polymeric microparticles, nanoparticles and liposomes. As phage therapy moves forward towards Phase III clinical trials, the review concludes by looking at promising new approaches for micro- and nanoencapsulation of phages and how these may address gaps in the field.",positive,,,,

This comprehensive review explores the historical context, the modern resurgence of phage therapy, and phage-facilitated advancements in medical and technological fields. It details the mechanisms of action and applications of phages in treating MDR bacterial infections, particularly those associated with biofilms and intracellular pathogens. The review further highlights innovative uses of phages in vaccine development, cancer therapy, and as gene delivery vectors. Despite its targeted and efficient approach, phage therapy faces challenges related to phage stability, immune response, and regulatory approval. By examining these areas in detail, this review underscores the immense potential and remaining hurdles in integrating phage-based therapies into modern medical practices.",positive,,,,
39231230,Essential phage component induces resistance of bacterial community,"Despite extensive knowledge on phage resistance at bacterium level, the resistance of bacterial communities is still not well-understood. Given its ubiquity, it is essential to understand resistance at the community level. We performed quantitative investigations on the dynamics of phage infection in Klebsiella pneumoniae biofilms. We found that the biofilms quickly developed resistance and resumed growth. Instead of mutations, the resistance was caused by unassembled phage tail fibers released by the phage-lysed bacteria. The tail fibers degraded the bacterial capsule essential for infection and induced spreading of capsule loss in the biofilm, and tuning tail fiber and capsule levels altered the resistance. Latent infections sustained in the biofilm despite resistance, allowing stable phage-bacteria coexistence. Last, we showed that the resistance exposed vulnerabilities in the biofilm. Our findings indicate that phage lysate plays important roles in shaping phage-biofilm interactions and open more dimensions for the rational design of strategies to counter bacteria with phage.",positive,,,,
28828194,Phage therapy: An alternative to antibiotics in the age of multi-drug resistance,"The practice of phage therapy, which uses bacterial viruses (phages) to treat bacterial infections, has been around for almost a century. The universal decline in the effectiveness of antibiotics has generated renewed interest in revisiting this practice. Conventionally, phage therapy relies on the use of naturally-occurring phages to infect and lyse bacteria at the site of infection. Biotechnological advances have further expanded the repertoire of potential phage therapeutics to include novel strategies using bioengineered phages and purified phage lytic proteins. Current research on the use of phages and their lytic proteins, specifically against multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, suggests phage therapy has the potential to be used as either an alternative or a supplement to antibiotic treatments. Antibacterial therapies, whether phage- or antibiotic-based, each have relative advantages and disadvantages; accordingly, many considerations must be taken into account when designing novel therapeutic approaches for preventing and treating bacterial infections. Although much is still unknown about the interactions between phage, bacteria, and human host, the time to take phage therapy seriously seems to be rapidly approaching.",positive,,,,
37268007,Developing Phage Therapy That Overcomes the Evolution of Bacterial Resistance,"The global rise of antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens and the waning efficacy of antibiotics urge consideration of alternative antimicrobial strategies. Phage therapy is a classic approach where bacteriophages (bacteria-specific viruses) are used against bacterial infections, with many recent successes in personalized medicine treatment of intractable infections. However, a perpetual challenge for developing generalized phage therapy is the expectation that viruses will exert selection for target bacteria to deploy defenses against virus attack, causing evolution of phage resistance during patient treatment. Here we review the two main complementary strategies for mitigating bacterial resistance in phage therapy: minimizing the ability for bacterial populations to evolve phage resistance and driving (steering) evolution of phage-resistant bacteria toward clinically favorable outcomes. We discuss future research directions that might further address the phage-resistance problem, to foster widespread development and deployment of therapeutic phage strategies that outsmart evolved bacterial resistance in clinical settings.",positive,,,,
39332413,Genomic surveillance as a scalable framework for precision phage therapy against antibiotic-resistant pathogens,"Phage therapy is gaining increasing interest in the fight against critically antibiotic-resistant nosocomial pathogens. However, the narrow host range of bacteriophages hampers the development of broadly effective phage therapeutics and demands precision approaches. Here, we combine large-scale phylogeographic analysis with high-throughput phage typing to guide the development of precision phage cocktails targeting carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, a top-priority pathogen. Our analysis reveals that a few strain types dominate infections in each world region, with their geographical distribution remaining stable within 6 years. As we demonstrate in Eastern Europe, this spatiotemporal distribution enables preemptive preparation of region-specific phage collections that target most local infections. Finally, we showcase the efficacy of phage cocktails against prevalent strain types using in vitro and animal infection models. Ultimately, genomic surveillance identifies patients benefiting from the same phages across geographical scales, thus providing a scalable framework for precision phage therapy.",positive,,,,
33388538,Phage-specific antibodies,"Antibodies specific to phage virions have been observed many times, both in animals and in humans. Phages induce the T-dependent type of immune response, which is fundamental for immunological memory and long retention of abilities to recognize and respond to foreign epitopes. Experimental models have shown that phage-specific antibodies can be devastating for a phage in vivo. Observations from phage treatment in humans demonstrate however that antibodies do not necessarily hinder phage therapy. Controlling effective doses may help in controlling the immune response to phage and to create 'therapeutic windows' for the phage. Phage therapy design may also benefit from understanding phage antigenicity and predicting possible cross-reactions between antibodies specific to different phages.",positive,,,,

Although these viruses were first discovered in 1917, the development of phage therapy was impacted by the discovery of antibiotics, which spread more quickly and effectively in medical practice. Despite this, phage therapy has a long history in Eastern Europe; however, Western countries are currently striving to reintroduce phage therapy as a tool in the fight against diseases caused by drug-resistant bacteria.

34978219,Seroprevalence of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 and correlates of infection in Jordan,"

Background: Herpes infections are common infections among populations. Herein, a cross-sectional study was used to determine the seroprevalence of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) IgG antibodies and their association with potential infection risk factors among Jordanians.

Methods: A total of 759 serum samples were collected (January to February 2020) and analyzed for HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Estimates for population seropositivity were determined by weighting the age-specific seroprevalence by the size of the population in each age stratum.

Results: The population estimate for HSV-1 seroprevalence was 75.3%. After adjustment for possible confounders, regression analysis revealed higher seroprevalence with increase in age (p < 0.005) and low household income (p = 0.002). The population estimate for HSV-2 seroprevalence was 2.9%. No significant differences in HSV-2 seroprevalence were observed in association with age, gender, family size, educational level, and socioeconomic status, likely due to low seropositivity.

Conclusions: Jordanians have high HSV-1 and low HSV-2 seroprevalence. Periodical studies might be needed to evaluate changes in HSV-1 and HSV-2 seroprevalence over time. This study provides essential epidemiological data for Jordan and the Middle East and North Africa region.

Forestry workers are at high risk of TBD because of frequent exposure to tick bites.AimWe aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) antibodies among forestry workers in northern France. We compared seroprevalence by geographical area and assessed factors associated with seropositivity.MethodsBetween 2019 and 2020, we conducted a randomised cross-sectional seroprevalence survey. Borrelia burgdorferi sl seropositivity was defined as positive ELISA and positive or equivocal result in western blot. Seropositivity for TBEV was defined as positive result from two ELISA tests, confirmed by serum neutralisation. We calculated weighted seroprevalence and adjusted prevalence ratios to determine association between potential risk factors and seropositivity.ResultsA total of 1,778 forestry workers participated. Seroprevalence for B. burgdorferi sl was 15.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): 13.9-17.3), 3.5 times higher in the eastern regions than in the western and increased with seniority and with weekly time in a forest environment. Seroprevalence was 2.5 times higher in forestry workers reporting a tick bite during past years and reporting usually not removing ticks rapidly. Seroprevalence for TBEV was 0.14% (95% CI: 0.05-0.42).ConclusionWe assessed for the first time seroprevalence of B. burgdorferi sl and TBEV antibodies among forestry workers in northern France.

27671461,Hepatitis E in Norway: seroprevalence in humans and swine,"In Norway, no published data on seroprevalence of hepatitis E virus (HEV) in humans and swine exists. Serum samples from blood donors, veterinarians, swine farm workers and swine were analysed by ELISA to estimate the seroprevalence of HEV in Norway and to investigate the association between direct contact with swine and HEV seroprevalence in humans. The seroprevalence of HEV IgG antibodies was 30% (24/79) in farm workers, 13% (21/163) in veterinarians, 14% (162/1200) in blood donors and 90% (137/153) in swine. Our results show a high seroprevalence of HEV in humans and swine in Norway. HEV seroprevalence in farm workers and blood donors increased with age, and veterinarians working with swine were twice as likely to be HEV seropositive compared to other veterinarians. High HEV seroprevalence in farm workers and veterinarians working with swine support previous reports suggesting swine as a reservoir for HEV infections in humans in Europe.",positive,,,,
32730849,Lipoproteins and lipids in cardiovascular disease: from mechanistic insights to therapeutic targeting,"With cardiovascular disease being the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, effective and cost-efficient therapies to reduce cardiovascular risk are highly needed. Lipids and lipoprotein particles crucially contribute to atherosclerosis as underlying pathology of cardiovascular disease and influence inflammatory processes as well as function of leukocytes, vascular and cardiac cells, thereby impacting on vessels and heart. Statins form the first-line therapy with the aim to block cholesterol synthesis, but additional lipid-lowering drugs are sometimes needed to achieve low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol target values. Furthermore, beyond LDL cholesterol, also other lipid mediators contribute to cardiovascular risk. This review comprehensively discusses low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, lipoprotein (a), triglycerides as well as fatty acids and derivatives in the context of cardiovascular disease, providing mechanistic insights into their role in pathological processes impacting on cardiovascular disease.

These gut microbiota derived metabolites play critical roles in maintaining a healthy cardiovascular function, and if dysregulated, potentially causally linked to CVD. A better understanding of the function and dynamics of gut microbiota derived metabolites holds great promise toward mechanistic predicative CVD biomarker discoveries and precise interventions.",negative,,,,
37721168,Vagus Nerve Stimulation and Inflammation in Cardiovascular Disease: A State-of-the-Art Review,"Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has been found to exert anti-inflammatory effects in different clinical settings and has been associated with improvement of clinical outcomes. However, evidence on the mechanistic link between the potential association of inflammatory status with clinical outcomes following VNS is scarce. This review aims to summarize the existing knowledge linking VNS with inflammation and its potential link with major outcomes in cardiovascular diseases, in both preclinical and clinical studies. Existing data show that in the setting of myocardial ischemia and reperfusion, VNS seems to reduce inflammation resulting in reduced infarct size and reduced incidence of ventricular arrhythmias during reperfusion. Furthermore, VNS has a protective role in vascular function following myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. Atrial fibrillation burden has also been reduced by VNS, whereas suppression of inflammation may be a potential mechanism for this effect. In the setting of heart failure, VNS was found to improve systolic function and reverse cardiac remodeling. In summary, existing experimental data show a reduction in inflammatory markers by VNS, which may cause improved clinical outcomes in cardiovascular diseases. However, more data are needed to evaluate the association between the inflammatory status with the clinical outcomes following VNS.",negative,,,,
28408026,The Aging Cardiovascular System: Understanding It at the Cellular and Clinical Levels,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) presents a great burden for elderly patients, their caregivers, and health systems. Structural and functional alterations of vessels accumulate throughout life, culminating in increased risk of developing CVD. The growing elderly population worldwide highlights the need to understand how aging promotes CVD in order to develop new strategies to confront this challenge. This review provides examples of some major unresolved clinical problems encountered in daily cardiovascular practice as we care for elderly patients. Next, the authors summarize the current understanding of the mechanisms implicated in cardiovascular aging, and the potential for targeting novel pathways implicated in endothelial dysfunction, mitochondrial oxidative stress, chromatin remodeling, and genomic instability. Lastly, the authors consider critical aspects of vascular repair, including autologous transplantation of bone marrow-derived stem cells in elderly patients.",negative,,,,
34725139,Cardiovascular Disease in Pregnancy,"Cardiovascular disease remains a major contributor to rising maternal morbidity and mortality. Both the pregnant woman and fetus are exposed to many potential complications as a result of the physiologic changes of pregnancy. These changes can exacerbate existing cardiac disease, as well as lead to the development of de novo issues during gestation, delivery, and the postnatal period. For women with preexisting cardiac disease, including congenital malformations, valvular disease, coronary artery disease, and aortopathies, it is crucial that they receive multidisciplinary evaluation, counseling, and optimization before conception, as well as close monitoring and medication management during pregnancy. Close monitoring is also essential for patients who develop cardiovascular complications such as preeclampsia, cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, coronary events, and arrhythmias during pregnancy. In addition, concerning disparities in maternal morbidity and mortality exist across many dimensions, in part because of the lack of uniformity of care in different treatment settings. Establishment of multidisciplinary cardio-obstetric teams including representatives from cardiology, anesthesia, obstetrics, maternal-fetal medicine, and specialized nursing has proven instrumental to delivering evidence-based and equitable care to high-risk patients. Multidisciplinary teams should work to guide these patients through the preconception, antepartum, delivery, and postpartum phases to ensure appropriate care for weeks to years after pregnancy.",negative,,,,
35236765,Physical activity and exercise recommendations for patients with valvular heart disease,"There is a paucity of studies looking at the natural history of valvular heart disease (VHD) in exercising individuals, and exercise recommendations are largely based on expert consensus. All individuals with VHD should be encouraged to avoid sedentary behaviour by engaging in at least 150 min of physical activity every week, including strength training. There are generally no exercise restrictions to individuals with mild VHD. Regurgitant lesions are better tolerated compared with stenotic lesions and as such the recommendations are more permissive for moderate-to-severe regurgitant VHD. Individuals with severe aortic regurgitation can still partake in moderate-intensity exercise provided the left ventricle (LV) and aorta are not significantly dilated and the ejection fraction (EF) remains >50%. Similarly, individuals with severe mitral regurgitation can partake in moderate-intensity exercise if the LV end-diastolic diameter <60 mm, the EF ?60%, resting pulmonary artery pressure <50 mm Hg and there is an absence of arrhythmias on exercise testing. Conversely, individuals with severe aortic or mitral stenosis are advised to partake in low-intensity exercise. For individuals with bicuspid aortic valve, in the absence of aortopathy, the guidance for tricuspid aortic valve dysfunction applies. Mitral valve prolapse has several clinical, ECG and cardiac imaging markers of increased arrhythmic risk; and if any are present, individuals should refrain from high-intensity exercise.

36162818,"The impact of coffee subtypes on incident cardiovascular disease, arrhythmias, and mortality: long-term outcomes from the UK Biobank ","

Aims: Epidemiological studies report the beneficial effects of habitual coffee consumption on incident arrhythmia, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and mortality. However, the impact of different coffee preparations on cardiovascular outcomes and survival is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate associations between coffee subtypes on incident outcomes, utilizing the UK Biobank.

Methods and results: Coffee subtypes were defined as decaffeinated, ground, and instant, then divided into 0, <1, 1, 2-3, 4-5, and >5 cups/day, and compared with non-drinkers. Cardiovascular disease included coronary heart disease, cardiac failure, and ischaemic stroke. Cox regression modelling with hazard ratios (HRs) assessed associations with incident arrhythmia, CVD, and mortality. Outcomes were determined through ICD codes and death records. A total of 449 563 participants (median 58 years, 55.3% females) were followed over 12.5   0.7 years. Ground and instant coffee consumption was associated with a significant reduction in arrhythmia at 1-5 cups/day but not for decaffeinated coffee. The lowest risk was 4-5 cups/day for ground coffee [HR 0.83, confidence interval (CI) 0.76-0.91, P < 0.0001] and 2-3 cups/day for instant coffee (HR 0.88, CI 0.85-0.92, P < 0.0001). All coffee subtypes were associated with a reduction in incident CVD (the lowest risk was 2-3 cups/day for decaffeinated, P = 0.0093; ground, P < 0.0001; and instant coffee, P < 0.0001) vs. non-drinkers. All-cause mortality was significantly reduced for all coffee subtypes, with the greatest risk reduction seen with 2-3 cups/day for decaffeinated (HR 0.86, CI 0.81-0.91, P < 0.0001); ground (HR 0.73, CI 0.69-0.78, P < 0.0001); and instant coffee (HR 0.89, CI 0.86-0.93, P < 0.0001).

Conclusion: Decaffeinated, ground, and instant coffee, particularly at 2-3 cups/day, were associated with significant reductions in incident CVD and mortality. Ground and instant but not decaffeinated coffee was associated with reduced arrhythmia.

36456045,Adding Salt to Foods and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease,"

Background: We recently found that the frequency of adding salt to foods could reflect a person's long-term salt taste preference and sodium intake, and was significantly related to life expectancy.

Objective: We analyzed whether the frequency of adding salt to foods was associated with incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.

Methods: This study included 176,570 adults in UK Biobank who were initially free of CVD. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the association between the frequency of adding salt to foods and incident CVD events.

Results: During a median of 11.8 years of follow-up, 9,963 total CVD events, 6,993 ischemic heart disease (IHD) cases, 2,007 stroke cases, and 2,269 heart failure cases were documented. Lower frequency of adding salt to foods was significantly associated with lower risk of total CVD events after adjustment for covariates and the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet (a modified DASH score was used without considering sodium intake). Compared with the group of always adding salt to foods, the adjusted HRs were 0.81 (95% CI: 0.73-0.90), 0.79 (95% CI: 0.71-0.87), and 0.77 (95% CI: 0.70-0.84) across the groups of usually, sometimes, and never/rarely, respectively (P trend < 0.001). Among the subtypes of CVD, adding salt showed the strongest association with heart failure (P trend <0.001), followed by IHD (P trend < 0.001), but was not associated with stroke. We found that participants who combined a DASH-style diet with the lowest frequency of adding salt had the lowest CVD risk.

Conclusions: Our findings indicate that lower frequency of adding salt to foods is associated with lower risk of CVD, particularly heart failure and IHD.

37788949,Effect of genetically determined BCAA levels on cardiovascular diseases and their risk factors: A Mendelian randomization study,"

Background and aims: Observational studies have demonstrated that serum branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are associated with the risk of various cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and their risk factors. However, the causal effect is unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of genetically determined BCAA levels on CVDs and their risk factors using Mendelian randomization (MR).

Methods and results: We performed univariable and multivariable MR analyses using summary-level data from multiple GWASs and the FinnGen consortium to investigate the association between BCAA levels and the risk of CVDs (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and intracerebral hemorrhage) and their risk factors (atrial fibrillation, hypertension, heart failure, and valvular heart disease). We used the random-effects IVW approach as the primary statistical method and incorporated MR estimates from different data sources using the fixed-effects model. We found genetically determined total and individual BCAA levels and a high risk of hypertension. However, there is no evidence of a causal relationship between BCAA levels and 3 cardiovascular diseases and other their risk factors. The odds of hypertension increased per 1-SD increase in BCAA levels (OR = 1.02 95% CI: 1.01, 1.04; P = 0.005), valine (OR = 1.02 95% CI: 1.01, 1.03; P<0.0001), leucine (OR = 1.02 95% CI: 1.01, 1.04; P?0.01), and isoleucine (OR = 1.02 95% CI: 1.01, 1.03; P < 0.0001). This result was also significant in the multivariable MR.

Conclusions: This MR study suggests that total and individual BCAA levels could be associated with a high risk of hypertension.

37907844,Metabolic disorders and risk of cardiovascular diseases: a two-sample mendelian randomization study,"

Background: Metabolic disorders are increasing worldwide and are characterized by various risk factors such as abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, impaired glucose metabolism, and dyslipidemia. Observational studies suggested a bidirectional association between cardiovascular diseases and metabolic disorders and its components. However, the causal associations between them remained unclear. This study aims to investigate the causal relationship between metabolic disorders and cardiovascular disease through Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis.

Methods: A two-sample MR analysis based on publicly available genome-wide association studies were used to infer the causality. The single-nucleotide polymorphisms with potential pleiotropy were excluded by MR-PRESSO. The effect estimates were constructed using the random-effects inverse-variance-weighted method as the primary estimate. Furthermore, MR-Egger and weighted median were also performed to detect heterogeneity and pleiotropy.

Results: Genetically predicted metabolic disorders increased the risk for coronary heart disease (OR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.55-2.03, p < 0.001), myocardial infarction (OR = 1.75, 95% CI: 1.52-2.03, p < 0.001), heart failure (OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.14-1.39, p < 0.001), hypertension (OR = 1.01, 95% CI: 1.00-1.02, p = 0.002), and stroke (OR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.08-1.32, p < 0.001). The concordance of the results of various complementary sensitivity MR methods reinforces the causal relationship further.

Conclusion: This study provides evidence of a causal relationship between metabolic disorders and increased risk of coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, hypertension, and stroke. Special attention should be paid to improving metabolic disorders to reduce the development of cardiovascular diseases.

37939791,Metabolic disorders mediate the relation of miscarriage with cardiovascular diseases,"

Aims: The extent to which the contribution of pregnancy loss to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) can be explained by metabolic disorders is poorly elucidated but holds insights for reducing long-term cardiovascular risk. The aim of this study is to investigate the mediating effects of hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), and lipoprotein metabolism disorders on the association of miscarriage and stillbirth with coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and composite outcomes.

Methods and results: A total of 163 283 ever-gravid women (age 55.3   7.9 years) from the UK Biobank cohort without established metabolic disorders and CVDs were included and followed from 2007 to 2010 baseline until December 2020. Causal mediation analyses were used to estimate the proportion mediated. Hypertension mediated 11.1% (95% confidence interval, 3.7-18.5%) of the association between a history of miscarriage and incident CHD. Approximately, 9.5% (4.1-14.8%) of the effect of recurrent miscarriages on incident CHD was via hypertension, 8.4% (2.5-14.3%) of the effect was via lipoprotein metabolism disorders, 1.7% (0.5-2.9%) of the effect was via DM, and 10.7% (0.2-21.1%) of the effect of recurrent miscarriages on incident stroke was via hypertension. Hypertension mediated the largest proportion of effect for the atherosclerotic cardiovascular event (15.5% for a history of miscarriage and 9.4% for recurrent miscarriages), followed by lipoprotein metabolism disorders and DM.

Conclusion: Hypertension, DM, and lipoprotein metabolism disorders mediated the association between miscarriage and various cardiovascular outcomes in later life. In particular, hypertension mediated a large proportion of the relationship between miscarriage and atherosclerotic CVD.

35708569,Clinical Update in Women's Heart Disease,"The goal in selecting these recent articles was to help identify literature that may change the clinical practice of women's health for practitioners in the primary care setting. Articles were identified by reviewing high-impact medical and women's health journals, national guidelines, ACP JournalWise, and NEJM Journal Watch. In this clinical update, we selected recent publications relevant to the prevention, risk assessment, and diagnosis of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in women. Breastfeeding now has data suggesting a robust reduction in subsequent CVD, and migraine with aura and severe and early- and late-onset hot flashes can now be considered risk factors for CVD. The decision to initiate menopausal hormone therapy is influenced by estimation of underlying vascular risk, and new data suggest that CVD risk scores are more accurate in predicting CVD risk than the traditionally used age and years since menopause and should be incorporated into counseling. Finally, new data support the growing belief that breast arterial calcification on mammography is a promising noninvasive marker that can enhance CVD risk prediction in women.",negative,,,,
37721449,Cumulative social disadvantage and cardiovascular disease burden and mortality,"

Aims: To investigate the association between cumulative social disadvantage and cardiovascular burden and mortality in a large cohort of the general population.

Methods and results: Cross-sectional (n = 15 010, aged 35 to 74 years, baseline investigation period 2007 to 2012) and longitudinal data (5- and 10-year follow-ups from 2012 to 2022) from the Gutenberg Health Study were used to investigate the association between individual socioeconomic status (SES, measured via a validated questionnaire) and cardiovascular disease (CVD, composite of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic heart failure, peripheral artery disease, and/or venous thromboembolism) risk and mortality. Subjects with prevalent CVD had a lower SES sum score, as well as lower education, occupation, and household net-income scores (all P < 0.0001). Logistic regression analysis showed that a low SES (vs. high, defined by validated cut-offs) was associated with 19% higher odds of prevalent CVD [odds ratio (OR) 1.19, 95% CI 1.01; 1.40] in the fully adjusted model. At 5-year follow-up, low SES was associated with both increased cardiovascular [hazard ratio (HR) 5.36, 2.24; 12.82] and all-cause mortality (HR 2.23, 1.51; 3.31). At 10-year follow-up, low SES was associated with a 68% higher risk of incident CVD (OR 1.68, 1.12; 2.47) as well as 86% higher all-cause mortality (HR 1.86, 1.55; 2.24). In general, the education and occupation scores were stronger related to risk of CVD and death than the household net-income score. Low SES was estimated to account for 451.45 disability-adjusted life years per 1000 people (years lived with disability 373.41/1000 and years of life lost 78.03/1000) and an incidence rate of 11 CVD cases and 3.47 CVD deaths per 1000 people per year. The population attributable fraction for CVD incidence after 5 years was 4% due to low SES.

Conclusion: Despite universal healthcare access, cumulative social disadvantage remains associated with higher risk of CVD and mortality. Dimensions of education and occupation, but not household net income, are associated with outcomes of interest.

35125247,Chronodisruption and cardiovascular disease,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is an important challenge for clinicians, researchers and governments to reduce the impact on the global health burden and socioeconomic costs. Moreover, far from diminishing, cardiometabolic risk factors leading to CVD development are on the rise. In order to stop the CVD pandemic, it is not enough to merely attempt to control traditional risk factors. In this regard, chronobiology, the science that studies biological rhythms, has become an important field in research in the last years. Circadian disruption or chronodisruption, defined as a relevant disturbance of the internal temporal order of physiological circadian rhythms significantly increases the risk of CVD. In this article we review some of the evidence that has made chronobiology one of the most emerging scenarios to take into account in routine clinical practice in which a translation of all this evidence should be mandatory.",negative,,,,
33969961,Gut microbiota and cardiovascular diseases axis,"Gut microbiota, a term that includes microorganisms present in the gastrointestinal tract, has become very attractive lately due to its propensity to act as a virtual organ with endocrine functions, generating various bio-active metabolites, while playing an important role in human health and diseases, including cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Focusing on the latter field, gastrointestinal dysbiosis that is the imbalance in the gut microbiota composition has been linked to various pathologies such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction and heart failure. Several pathways were demonstrated to play a role in the complex and intertwined association between the gut microbiota and host, including metabolic endotoxemia, alteration of pattern recognition receptors and short-chain fatty acids, uremic toxins, bile acids and trimethylamine-N-oxide levels, leading to CVDs. Understanding these pathways can allow the identification of metabolites that could be useful predictors for detecting incipient CVDs stages and potential therapeutic targets. In this review, we summarize the pathways associating the gut microbiota with CVDs.",negative,,,,
36539452,Single-cell transcriptomics for the assessment of cardiac disease,"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death globally.

State-of-the-art, large-scale, single-cell and single-nucleus transcriptomics facilitate the exploration of the cardiac cellular landscape at an unprecedented level, beyond its descriptive features, and can further our understanding of the mechanisms of disease and guide functional studies. In this Review, we provide an overview of the technical challenges in the experimental design of single-cell and single-nucleus transcriptomics studies, as well as a discussion of the type of inferences that can be made from the data derived from these studies. Furthermore, we describe novel findings derived from transcriptomics studies for each major cardiac cell type in both health and disease, and from development to adulthood. This Review also provides a guide to interpreting the exhaustive list of newly identified cardiac cell types and states, and highlights the consensus and discordances in annotation, indicating an urgent need for standardization. We describe advanced applications such as integration of single-cell data with spatial transcriptomics to map genes and cells on tissue and define cellular microenvironments that regulate homeostasis and disease progression. Finally, we discuss current and future translational and clinical implications of novel transcriptomics approaches, and provide an outlook of how these technologies will change the way we diagnose and treat heart disease.",negative,,,,
37481694,The burden of cardiovascular disease attributable to high body mass index-an observational study,"

Aim: This study aims to provide a timely and comprehensive estimate of the current burden and temporal trend of cardiovascular disease (CVD) attributable to high body mass index (HBMI).

Methods: We systematically assessed the current burden and temporal trend of CVD attributable to HBMI by calendar year, age, sex, region, nation, socioeconomic status, and specific CVD based on the most recent Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2019.

Results: Globally, the numbers of CVD-related disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and deaths attributable to HBMI has more than doubled from 1990 to 2019. Conversely, the age-standardized rates (ASRs) of CVD-related DALYs and deaths attributable to HBMI showed a slight downward trend, with estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) of -0.18 and -0.43, respectively. The ASRs of CVD-related DALYs and deaths attributable to HBMI were lower in low and high Socio-demographic Index (SDI) regions in 2019, but higher in middle and high-middle SDI regions. The ASRs of CVD-related DALYs and deaths attributable to HBMI showed a downward trend in the high SDI regions from 1990 to 2019, but showed an upward trend in the low and low-middle SDI regions. The leading causes of CVD burden attributable to HBMI were ischemic heart disease, stroke, hypertensive heart disease, and atrial fibrillation/flutter in 2019.

Conclusion: The CVD burden attributable to HBMI remains a challenging global health concern. Policymakers in high and increasing burden regions can learn from some valuable experiences of low and decreasing burden regions and develop more targeted and specific strategies to prevent and reduce CVD burden attributable to HBMI.

26555448,Pediatric vasculitis,"

Purpose of review: The aim of this review is to define childhood vasculitis and to highlight new causative factors and treatment modalities under the guidance of recently published studies.

Recent findings: Childhood vasculitis is difficult to diagnose because of the wide variation in the symptoms and signs. New nomenclature and classification criteria were proposed for the diagnosis of pediatric vasculitis. Recently, progress has been made toward understanding the genetic susceptibility to pediatric vasculitis as it was in other diseases. Various radiological techniques provide great opportunities in establishing the diagnosis of pediatric vasculitis. Mild central nervous system disease can accompany Henoch-Schonlein purpura and can go unnoticed. Antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis is rare in children. Increased severity of the disease, subglottic stenosis, and renal disease are described more frequently among children. Biological therapies are used with success in children as in adults. Future studies, whose aims are to evaluate treatment responses, prognosis and to design guidelines for activity, and damage index of vasculitis for children are required.

Summary: Henoch-Schonlein purpura and Kawasaki disease are the most frequent vasculitides of children. Experience from adult studies for treatment and prognosis are usually used because of low incidence of other vasculitides in children. Multicenter studies of pediatric vasculitis should be conducted to detail treatment responses and prognosis in children.

34858028,Promising Nutritional Fruits Against Cardiovascular Diseases: An Overview of Experimental Evidence and Understanding Their Mechanisms of Action,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in both developed and developing countries, affecting millions of individuals each year. Despite the fact that successful therapeutic drugs for the management and treatment of CVDs are available on the market, nutritional fruits appear to offer the greatest benefits to the heart and have been proved to alleviate CVDs. Experimental studies have also demonstrated that nutritional fruits have potential protective effects against CVDs. The aim of the review was to provide a comprehensive summary of scientific evidence on the effect of 10 of the most commonly available nutritional fruits reported against CVDs and describe the associated mechanisms of action. Relevant literatures were searched and collected from several scientific databases including PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar and Scopus. In the context of CVDs, 10 commonly consumed nutritious fruits including apple, avocado, grapes, mango, orange, kiwi, pomegranate, papaya, pineapple, and watermelon were analysed and addressed. The cardioprotective mechanisms of the 10 nutritional fruits were also compiled and highlighted. Overall, the present review found that the nutritious fruits and their constituents have significant benefits for the management and treatment of CVDs such as myocardial infarction, hypertension, peripheral artery disease, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathies, dyslipidemias, ischemic stroke, aortic aneurysm, atherosclerosis, cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure, diabetic cardiovascular complications, drug-induced cardiotoxicity and cardiomyopathy. Among the 10 nutritional fruits, pomegranate and grapes have been well explored, and the mechanisms of action are well documented against CVDs. All of the nutritional fruits mentioned are edible and readily accessible on the market. Consuming these fruits, which may contain varying amounts of active constituents depending on the food source and season, the development of nutritious fruits-based health supplements would be more realistic for consistent CVD protection",negative,,,,
38328916,Cost of Cardiovascular Disease Event and Cardiovascular Disease Treatment-Related Complication Hospitalizations in the United States,"

Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is among the costliest conditions in the United States, and cost-effectiveness analyses can be used to assess economic impact and prioritize CVD treatments. We aimed to develop standardized, nationally representative CVD events and selected possible CVD treatment-related complication hospitalization costs for use in cost-effectiveness analyses.

Methods: Nationally representative costs were derived using publicly available inpatient hospital discharge data from the 2012-2018 National Inpatient Sample. Events were identified using the principal International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes. Facility charges were converted to costs using charge-to-cost ratios, and total costs were estimated by applying a published professional fee ratio. All costs are reported in 2021 US dollars. Mean costs were estimated for events overall and stratified by age, sex, and survival status at discharge. Annual costs to the US health care system were estimated by multiplying the mean annual number of events by the mean total cost per discharge.

Results: The annual mean number of hospital discharges among CVD events was the highest for heart failure (1 087 000 per year) and cerebrovascular disease (800 600 per year). The mean cost per hospital discharge was the highest for peripheral vascular disease ($33 700 [95% CI, $33 300-$34 000]) and ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation ($32 500 [95% CI, $32 100-$32 900]). Hospitalizations contributing the most to annual US health care costs were heart failure ($19 500 [95% CI, $19 300-$19 800] million) and acute myocardial infarction ($18 300, [95% CI, $18 200-$18 500] million). Acute kidney injury was the most frequent possible treatment complication (515 000 per year), and bradycardia had the highest mean hospitalization costs ($17 400 [95% CI, $17 200-$17 500]).

Conclusions: The hospitalization cost estimates and statistical code reported in the current study have the potential to increase transparency and comparability of cost-effectiveness analyses for CVD in the United States.

Identifying individuals at increased cardiovascular risk at an asymptomatic, sub-clinical stage is of paramount importance for minimizing disease progression as well as the substantial health and economic burden associated with overt CVD. Vascular ageing (VA) involves the deterioration in vascular structure and function over time and ultimately leads to damage in the heart, brain, kidney, and other organs. Vascular ageing encompasses the cumulative effect of all cardiovascular risk factors on the arterial wall over the life course and thus may help identify those at elevated cardiovascular risk, early in disease development. Although the concept of VA is gaining interest clinically, it is seldom measured in routine clinical practice due to lack of consensus on how to characterize VA as physiological vs. pathological and various practical issues. In this state-of-the-art review and as a network of scientists, clinicians, engineers, and industry partners with expertise in VA, we address six questions related to VA in an attempt to increase knowledge among the broader medical community and move the routine measurement of VA a little closer from bench towards bedside.",negative,,,,
37920978,Evolution of Value in American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Clinical Practice Guidelines,"

Background: In January 2014, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association released a policy statement arguing for the inclusion of cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and value assessments in clinical practice guidelines. It is unclear whether subsequent guidelines changed how they incorporated such concepts.

Methods: We analyzed guidelines of cardiovascular disease subconditions with a guideline released before and after 2014. We counted the words (total and per page) for 8 selected value- or CEA-related terms and compared counts and rates of terms per page in the guidelines before and after 2014. We counted the number of recommendations with at least 1 reference to a CEA or a CEA-related article to compare the ratios of such recommendations to all recommendations before and after 2014. We looked for the inclusion of the value assessment system recommended by the writing committee of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association policy statement of 2014.

Results: We analyzed 20 guidelines of 10 different cardiovascular disease subconditions. Seven of the 10 cardiovascular disease subconditions had guidelines with a greater term per page rate after 2014 than before 2014. Across all 20 guidelines, the proportion of recommendations with at least 1 reference to a CEA changed from 0.44% to 1.99% (P<0.01). The proportion of recommendations with at least 1 reference to a CEA-related article changed from 1.02% to 3.34% (P<0.01). Only 3 guidelines used a value assessment system.

Conclusions: The proportion of recommendations with at least 1 reference to a CEA or CEA-related article was low before and after 2014 for most of the subconditions, however, with substantial variation in this finding across the guidelines included in our analysis. There is a need to organize existing CEA information better and produce more policy-relevant CEAs so guideline writers can more easily make recommendations that incentivize high-value care and caution against using low-value care.

19419257,Alcohol and cardiovascular diseases,"With respect to cardiovascular disorders, epidemiologic studies support the hypothesis of increased risks among heavy alcohol drinkers and indicate a lower risk among lighter drinkers. Increased cardiovascular risks of heavy drinking include cardiomyopathy, systemic hypertension, supraventricular arrhythmias, hemorrhagic stroke and heart failure that is not associated with coronary artery disease (CAD). Light-to-moderate drinking is probably unrelated to increased risk of any cardiovascular condition and is related to lower risks of CAD, ischemic stroke and CAD-related heart failure. A protective alcohol-CAD hypothesis is supported by plausible biological mechanisms attributable to ethyl alcohol. Possible nonalcohol beneficial components in wine (especially red) could explain the extra protection of wine, but a healthier pattern of drinking or more favorable risk traits in wine drinkers may also be involved. Advice regarding the advisability of alcohol drinking for health needs to be individualized according to specific risks and benefits. ",negative,,,,
37650634,"Electromagnetic field and cardiovascular diseases: A state-of-the-art review of diagnostic, therapeutic, and predictive values","Despite encouraging advances in early diagnosis and treatment, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remained a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Increasing evidence has shown that the electromagnetic field (EMF) influences many biological processes, which has attracted much attention for its potential therapeutic and diagnostic modalities in multiple diseases, such as musculoskeletal disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Nonionizing EMF has been studied as a therapeutic or diagnostic tool in CVDs. In this review, we summarize the current literature ranging from in vitro to clinical studies focusing on the therapeutic potential (external EMF) and diagnostic potential (internal EMF generated from the heart) of EMF in CVDs. First, we provided an overview of the therapeutic potential of EMF and associated mechanisms in the context of CVDs, including cardiac arrhythmia, myocardial ischemia, atherosclerosis, and hypertension. Furthermore, we investigated the diagnostic and predictive value of magnetocardiography in CVDs. Finally, we discussed the critical steps necessary to translate this promising approach into clinical practice.",negative,,,,
35067447,Education inequalities in cardiovascular and coronary heart disease in Italy and the role of behavioral and biological risk factors,"

Background and aims: Behavioral and biological risk factors (BBRF) explain part of the variability in socioeconomic differences in health. The present study aimed at evaluating education differences in incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and coronary heart disease (CHD) in Italy and the role of BBRF.

Methods and results: All subjects aged 30-74 years (n = 132,686) who participated to the National Health Interview Surveys 2000 and 2005 were included and followed-up for ten years. Exposure to smoking, physical activity, overweight/obesity, diabetes and hypertension at baseline was considered. Education level was used as an indicator of socioeconomic status. The outcomes were incident cases of CVD and CHD. Hazard ratios by education level were estimated, adjusting for sociodemographic covariates and stratifying by sex and geographic area. The contribution of BBRF to education inequalities was estimated by counterfactual mediation analysis, in addition to the assessment of the risk attenuation by comparing the models including BBRF or not. 22,214 participants had a CVD event and 6173 a CHD event. After controlling for sociodemographic factors, the least educated men showed a 21% higher risk of CVD and a 17% higher risk of CHD compared to the most educated (41% and 61% among women). The mediating effect (natural indirect effect) of BBRF between extreme education levels was 52% for CVD and 84% for CHD among men (16% among women for CVD).

Conclusions: More effective strategies aiming at reducing socioeconomic disparities in CVD and CHD are needed, through programs targeting less educated people in combination with community-wide initiatives.

The situation is so alarming that every fourth person is having a lifetime risk of cancer. India registers more than 11 lakh new cases of cancer every year, whereas, this figure is above 14 million worldwide. Is cancer curable? The short answer to this question is ""Yes."" In fact, all cancers are curable if they are caught early enough.

32273439,Metabolic reprogramming and cancer progression ,"Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of malignancy. As our understanding of the complexity of tumor biology increases, so does our appreciation of the complexity of tumor metabolism. Metabolic heterogeneity among human tumors poses a challenge to developing therapies that exploit metabolic vulnerabilities. Recent work also demonstrates that the metabolic properties and preferences of a tumor change during cancer progression. This produces distinct sets of vulnerabilities between primary tumors and metastatic cancer, even in the same patient or experimental model. We review emerging concepts about metabolic reprogramming in cancer, with particular attention on why metabolic properties evolve during cancer progression and how this information might be used to develop better therapeutic strategies.",negative,,,,
37316719,The neuroscience of cancer,"The nervous system regulates tissue stem and precursor populations throughout life. Parallel to roles in development, the nervous system is emerging as a critical regulator of cancer, from oncogenesis to malignant growth and metastatic spread. Various preclinical models in a range of malignancies have demonstrated that nervous system activity can control cancer initiation and powerfully influence cancer progression and metastasis. Just as the nervous system can regulate cancer progression, cancer also remodels and hijacks nervous system structure and function. Interactions between the nervous system and cancer occur both in the local tumour microenvironment and systemically. Neurons and glial cells communicate directly with malignant cells in the tumour microenvironment through paracrine factors and, in some cases, through neuron-to-cancer cell synapses. Additionally, indirect interactions occur at a distance through circulating signals and through influences on immune cell trafficking and function. Such cross-talk among the nervous system, immune system and cancer-both systemically and in the local tumour microenvironment-regulates pro-tumour inflammation and anti-cancer immunity. Elucidating the neuroscience of cancer, which calls for interdisciplinary collaboration among the fields of neuroscience, developmental biology, immunology and cancer biology, may advance effective therapies for many of the most difficult to treat malignancies.",negative,,,,

26289314,Glycosylation in cancer: mechanisms and clinical implications,"Despite recent progress in understanding the cancer genome, there is still a relative delay in understanding the full aspects of the glycome and glycoproteome of cancer. Glycobiology has been instrumental in relevant discoveries in various biological and medical fields, and has contributed to the deciphering of several human diseases. Glycans are involved in fundamental molecular and cell biology processes occurring in cancer, such as cell signalling and communication, tumour cell dissociation and invasion, cell-matrix interactions, tumour angiogenesis, immune modulation and metastasis formation. The roles of glycans in cancer have been highlighted by the fact that alterations in glycosylation regulate the development and progression of cancer, serving as important biomarkers and providing a set of specific targets for therapeutic intervention. This Review discusses the role of glycans in fundamental mechanisms controlling cancer development and progression, and their applications in oncology.",negative,,,,
28574057,New methods in the diagnosis of cancer and gene therapy of cancer based on nanoparticles,"Cancer is one of the leading cause of death in the world with the prevalence of >10 million mortalities annually. Current cancer treatments include surgical intervention, radiation, and taking chemotherapeutic drugs, which often kill the healthy cells and result in toxicity in patients. Therefore, researchers are looking for ways to be able to eliminate just cancerous cells. Intra-tumor heterogeneity of cancerous cells is the main obstacle on the way of an effective cancer treatment. However, better comprehension of molecular basis of tumor and the advent of new diagnostic technologies can help to improve the treatment of various cancers.

33081387,"Cancer Metabolism: Phenotype, Signaling and Therapeutic Targets","Aberrant metabolism is a major hallmark of cancer. Abnormal cancer metabolism, such as aerobic glycolysis and increased anabolic pathways, has important roles in tumorigenesis, metastasis, drug resistance, and cancer stem cells. Well-known oncogenic signaling pathways, such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT, Myc, and Hippo pathway, mediate metabolic gene expression and increase metabolic enzyme activities. Vice versa, deregulated metabolic pathways contribute to defects in cellular signal transduction pathways, which in turn provide energy, building blocks, and redox potentials for unrestrained cancer cell proliferation. Studies and clinical trials are being performed that focus on the inhibition of metabolic enzymes by small molecules or dietary interventions (e.g., fasting, calorie restriction, and intermittent fasting). Similar to genetic heterogeneity, the metabolic phenotypes of cancers are highly heterogeneous. This heterogeneity results from diverse cues in the tumor microenvironment and genetic mutations. Hence, overcoming metabolic plasticity is an important goal of modern cancer therapeutics. This review highlights recent findings on the metabolic phenotypes of cancer and elucidates the interactions between signal transduction pathways and metabolic pathways. We also provide novel rationales for designing the next-generation cancer metabolism drugs.",negative,,,,
21219185,Natural innate and adaptive immunity to cancer,"The immune system can identify and destroy nascent tumor cells in a process termed cancer immunosurveillance, which functions as an important defense against cancer. Recently, data obtained from numerous investigations in mouse models of cancer and in humans with cancer offer compelling evidence that particular innate and adaptive immune cell types, effector molecules, and pathways can sometimes collectively function as extrinsic tumor-suppressor mechanisms. However, the immune system can also promote tumor progression. Together, the dual host-protective and tumor-promoting actions of immunity are referred to as cancer immunoediting. In this review, we discuss the current experimental and human clinical data supporting a cancer immunoediting process that provide the fundamental basis for further study of immunity to cancer and for the rational design of immunotherapies against cancer.

36069534,"Current cancer burden in China: epidemiology, etiology, and prevention","Cancer has become the most common cause of death in China. Owing to rapid economic development, improved livelihood, and shifts in risk factors, cancer epidemiology has experienced substantial changes during the past several decades. In this review, we aim to describe the current cancer epidemiology of the main types of cancer in China, report major risk factors associated with cancer development, and summarize the contributions of the Chinese government to controlling the cancer burden. A total of 4,064,000 new cases were diagnosed in China in 2016. The most frequent types are lung cancer (828,100; 20.4%), colorectal cancer (408,000; 10.0%), and gastric cancer (396,500; 9.8%). Lung (657,000; 27.2%), liver (336,400, 13.9%), and stomach (288,500; 12.0%) cancers are the 3 most deadly cancers in the general population. The 5-year survival rate for cancer has dramatically increased in recent decades. However, liver and particularly pancreatic cancers still have the poorest prognosis. The main modifiable risk factors associated with cancer development include infectious agents, smoking, alcohol consumption, obesity, unhealthful dietary habits, and inadequate physical activity. The Chinese government has made unremitting efforts to decrease the cancer burden, including cancer education and investment in cancer screening programs. ",negative,,,,
28782469,Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors: Basics and Challenges,"Cancer is one of the most deadly diseases in the modern world. The last decade has witnessed dramatic advances in cancer treatment through immunotherapy. One extremely promising means to achieve anti-cancer immunity is to block the immune checkpoint pathways - mechanisms adopted by cancer cells to disguise themselves as regular components of the human body. Many review articles have described a variety of agents that are currently under extensive clinical evaluation. However, while checkpoint blockade is universally effective against a broad spectrum of cancer types and is mostly unrestricted by the mutation status of certain genes, only a minority of patients achieve a complete response. In this review, we summarize the basic principles of immune checkpoint inhibitors in both antibody and smallmolecule forms and also discuss potential mechanisms of resistance, which may shed light on further investigation to achieve higher clinical efficacy for these inhibitors.",negative,,,,
38760832,Aging and cancer,"Aging and cancer exhibit apparent links that we will examine in this review. The null hypothesis that aging and cancer coincide because both are driven by time, irrespective of the precise causes, can be confronted with the idea that aging and cancer share common mechanistic grounds that are referred to as 'hallmarks'. Indeed, several hallmarks of aging also contribute to carcinogenesis and tumor progression, but some of the molecular and cellular characteristics of aging may also reduce the probability of developing lethal cancer, perhaps explaining why very old age (> 90 years) is accompanied by a reduced incidence of neoplastic diseases. We will also discuss the possibility that the aging process itself causes cancer, meaning that the time-dependent degradation of cellular and supracellular functions that accompanies aging produces cancer as a byproduct or 'age-associated disease'. Conversely, cancer and its treatment may erode health and drive the aging process, as this has dramatically been documented for cancer survivors diagnosed during childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood. We conclude that aging and cancer are connected by common superior causes including endogenous and lifestyle factors, as well as by a bidirectional crosstalk, that together render old age not only a risk factor of cancer but also an important parameter that must be considered for therapeutic decisions.",negative,,,,

37059064,Impact of risk factors on early cancer evolution,"Recent identification of oncogenic cells within healthy tissues and the prevalence of indolent cancers found incidentally at autopsies reveal a greater complexity in tumor initiation than previously appreciated. The human body contains roughly 40 trillion cells of 200 different types that are organized within a complex three-dimensional matrix, necessitating exquisite mechanisms to restrain aberrant outgrowth of malignant cells that have the capacity to kill the host. Understanding how this defense is overcome to trigger tumorigenesis and why cancer is so extraordinarily rare at the cellular level is vital to future prevention therapies. In this review, we discuss how early initiated cells are protected from further tumorigenesis and the non-mutagenic pathways by which cancer risk factors promote tumor growth. By nature, the absence of permanent genomic alterations potentially renders these tumor-promoting mechanisms clinically targetable. Finally, we consider existing strategies for early cancer interception with perspectives on the next steps for molecular cancer prevention. ",negative,,,,

An increased focus on cancer lipid metabolism has unveiled a number of mechanisms that promote tumor growth and survival, many of which are independent of classical cellular bioenergetics. These mechanisms include modulation of ferroptotic-mediated cell death, support during tumor metastasis, and interactions with the cells of the tumor microenvironment. As such, targeting lipid metabolism for anti-cancer therapies is attractive, with recent work on small-molecule inhibitors identifying compounds to target lipid metabolism.

30612715,Targeting Cancer Cell Dormancy,"Cancer cell dormancy is a process whereby cells enter reversible cell cycle arrest, termed quiescence. Quiescence is essential for cancer cells to acquire additional mutations, to survive in a new environment and initiate metastasis, to become resistant to cancer therapy, and to evade immune destruction. Thus, dormant cancer cells are considered to be responsible for cancer progression. As we start to understand the mechanisms that enable quiescence, we can begin to develop pharmacological strategies to target dormant cancer cells. Herein, we summarize the major molecular mechanisms underlying the dormancy of disseminated tumor cells and drug-tolerant persister cells. We then analyze the current pharmacological strategies aimed (i) to keep cancer cells in the harmless dormant state, (ii) to reactivate dormant cells to increase their susceptibility to anti-proliferative drugs, and (iii) to eradicate dormant cancer cells.",negative,,,,

Changes in glycosylation patterns are a significant feature of cancer, are associated with a range of pathological activities in cancer-related processes, and serve as critical biomarkers providing new targets for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Glycoproteins like human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) for breast cancer, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) for liver cancer, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) for colon cancer, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) for prostate cancer are all tumor biomarkers approved for clinical use. Here, we introduce the diversity of glycosylation structures and newly discovered glycosylation substrate-glycosylated RNA (glycoRNA). This article focuses primarily on tumor metastasis, immune evasion, metabolic reprogramming, aberrant ferroptosis responses, and cellular senescence to illustrate the role of glycosylation in cancer.

34459009,Cancer evolution: Darwin and beyond,"Clinical and laboratory studies over recent decades have established branched evolution as a feature of cancer. However, while grounded in somatic selection, several lines of evidence suggest a Darwinian model alone is insufficient to fully explain cancer evolution. First, the role of macroevolutionary events in tumour initiation and progression contradicts Darwin's central thesis of gradualism. Whole-genome doubling, chromosomal chromoplexy and chromothripsis represent examples of single catastrophic events which can drive tumour evolution. Second, neutral evolution can play a role in some tumours, indicating that selection is not always driving evolution. Third, increasing appreciation of the role of the ageing soma has led to recent generalised theories of age-dependent carcinogenesis. Here, we review these concepts and others, which collectively argue for a model of cancer evolution which extends beyond Darwin. We also highlight clinical opportunities which can be grasped through targeting cancer vulnerabilities arising from non-Darwinian patterns of evolution.",negative,,,,
32482536,Senescent Cells in Cancer Therapy: Friends or Foes?,"Several cancer interventions induce DNA damage and promote senescence in cancer and nonmalignant cells. Senescent cells secrete a collection of proinflammatory factors collectively termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). SASP factors are able to potentiate various aspects of tumorigenesis, including proliferation, metastasis, and immunosuppression. Moreover, the accumulation and persistence of therapy-induced senescent cells can promote tissue dysfunction and the early onset of various age-related symptoms in treated cancer patients. Here, we review in detail the mechanisms by which cellular senescence contributes to cancer development and the side effects of cancer therapies. We also review how pharmacological interventions to eliminate senescent cells or inhibit SASP production can mitigate these negative effects and propose therapeutic strategies based on the age of the patient.",negative,,,,

28741511,Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and the Hallmarks of Cancer,"Tumor cells are often exposed to intrinsic and external factors that alter protein homeostasis, thus producing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. To cope with this, cells evoke an adaptive mechanism to restore ER proteostasis known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). The three main UPR signaling branches initiated by IRE1?, PERK, and ATF6 are crucial for tumor growth and aggressiveness as well as for microenvironment remodeling or resistance to treatment. We provide a comprehensive overview of the contribution of the UPR to cancer biology and the acquisition of malignant characteristics, thus highlighting novel aspects including inflammation, invasion and metastasis, genome instability, resistance to chemo/radiotherapy, and angiogenesis.

Thus, therapies against cell cycle machinery components can not only repress the division of cancer cells, but also reverse cancer metabolism and restore cancer immune surveillance. Besides the ongoing effects on the development of small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) of the cell cycle machinery, proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have recently been used to target these oncogenic proteins related to cell cycle progression.

40148026,Cell cycle dysregulation in cancer,"Cancer is a systemic manifestation of aberrant cell cycle activity and dysregulated cell growth. Genetic mutations can determine tumor onset by either augmenting cell division rates or restraining normal controls such as cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. As a result, tumor cells not only undergo uncontrolled cell division but also become compromised in their ability to exit the cell cycle accurately. Regulation of cell cycle progression is enabled by specific surveillance mechanisms known as cell cycle checkpoints, and aberrations in these signaling pathways often culminate in cancer. For instance, DNA damage checkpoints, which preclude the generation and augmentation of DNA damage in the G1, S, and G2 cell cycle phases, are often defective in cancer cells, allowing cell division in spite of the accumulation of genetic errors. Notably, tumors have evolved to become dependent on checkpoints for their survival. For example, checkpoint pathways such as the DNA replication stress checkpoint and the mitotic checkpoint rarely undergo mutations and remain intact because any aberrant activity could result in irreparable damage or catastrophic chromosomal missegregation leading to cell death. In this review, we initially focus on cell cycle control pathways and specific functions of checkpoint signaling involved in normal and cancer cells and then proceed to examine how cell cycle control and checkpoint mechanisms can provide new therapeutic windows that can be exploited for cancer therapy. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: DNA damage checkpoints are often defective in cancer cells, allowing cell division in spite of the accumulation of genetic errors. Conversely, DNA replication stress and mitotic checkpoints rarely undergo mutations because any aberrant activity could result in irreparable damage or catastrophic chromosomal missegregation, leading to cancer cell death. This review focuses on the checkpoint signaling mechanisms involved in cancer cells and how an emerging understanding of these pathways can provide new therapeutic opportunities for cancer therapy.

38664705,Pan-cancer analysis implicates novel insights of lactate metabolism into immunotherapy response prediction and survival prognostication," Background: Immunotherapy has emerged as a potent clinical approach for cancer treatment, but only subsets of cancer patients can benefit from it. Targeting lactate metabolism (LM) in tumor cells as a method to potentiate anti-tumor immune responses represents a promising therapeutic strategy.

Methods: Public single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-seq) cohorts collected from patients who received immunotherapy were systematically gathered and scrutinized to delineate the association between LM and the immunotherapy response. A novel LM-related signature (LM.SIG) was formulated through an extensive examination of 40 pan-cancer scRNA-seq cohorts. Then, multiple machine learning (ML) algorithms were employed to validate the capacity of LM.SIG for immunotherapy response prediction and survival prognostication based on 8 immunotherapy transcriptomic cohorts and 30 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) pan-cancer datasets. Moreover, potential targets for immunotherapy were identified based on 17 CRISPR datasets and validated via in vivo and in vitro experiments.

Results: The assessment of LM was confirmed to possess a substantial relationship with immunotherapy resistance in 2 immunotherapy scRNA-seq cohorts. Based on large-scale pan-cancer data, there exists a notably adverse correlation between LM.SIG and anti-tumor immunity as well as imbalance infiltration of immune cells, whereas a positive association was observed between LM.SIG and pro-tumorigenic signaling. Utilizing this signature, the ML model predicted immunotherapy response and prognosis with an AUC of 0.73/0.80 in validation sets and 0.70/0.87 in testing sets respectively. Notably, LM.SIG exhibited superior predictive performance across various cancers compared to published signatures. Subsequently, CRISPR screening identified LDHA as a pan-cancer biomarker for estimating immunotherapy response and survival probability which was further validated using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and spatial transcriptomics (ST) datasets. Furthermore, experiments demonstrated that LDHA deficiency in pancreatic cancer elevated the CD8+ T cell antitumor immunity and improved macrophage antitumoral polarization, which in turn enhanced the efficacy of immunotherapy.

31932757,Outcompeting cancer,"The tumour microenvironment plays a critical role in determining tumour fate. Within that environment, and indeed throughout epithelial tissues, cells experience competition with their neighbours, with those less fit being eliminated by fitter adjacent cells. Herein we discuss evidence suggesting that mutations in cancer cells may be selected for their ability to exploit cell competition to kill neighbouring host cells, thereby facilitating tumour expansion. In some instances, cell competition may help host tissues to defend against cancer, by removing neoplastic and aneuploid cells. Cancer risk factors, such as high-sugar or high-fat diet and inflammation, impact cell competition-based host defences, suggesting that their effect on tumour risk may in part be accounted for by their influence on cell competition. We propose that interventions aimed at modifying the strength and direction of cell competition could induce cancer cell killing and form the basis for novel anticancer therapies.",negative,,,,
33560020,Cancer and schizophrenia,"

Purpose of review: On the basis of articles published in 2018, 2019 and 2020, the first aim of this review is to present estimates of incidence rates and excess mortality of overall cancer and organ-specific cancers for patients with schizophrenia compared with the general population.The second aim is to explore if underdiagnosis and undertreatment can explain - at least partly - the increased mortality of cancer in patients with schizophrenia compared with the general population.

Recent findings: Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia have an approximately 50% increased risk of death by cancer compared to age and sex-matched people in the general population. Studies have confirmed an increased mortality from breast, lung and colon cancer in patients with schizophrenia.Analyses of incidence of cancer revealed contradicting results, with some studies showing no increase in incidence and others a modestly increased incidence in overall cancer. Studies of incidence of specific types of cancers showed modestly increased risk of pancreas, oesophagus, breast cancer and contradicting results regarding lung cancer.In studies identified that compared to the general population, patients with schizophrenia were at an increased risk of not being diagnosed or treated for cancer before death of cancer. In addition, patients with schizophrenia had lower chances of getting optimal treatment for colon cancer after diagnosis.

Summary: This review indicates that patients with schizophrenia are at increased risk of dying of cancer and of several specific types of cancer. This increased mortality can be reduced if the price of tobacco is increased, if smoking cessation programmes are offered systematically, screening programs better implemented in this highly vulnerable group, and if procedures to facilitate access to early diagnosis and effective treatment are implemented.

28093447,Inflammasomes and Cancer,"Inflammation affects all stages of tumorigenesis. A key signaling pathway leading to acute and chronic inflammation is through activation of the caspase-1 inflammasome. Inflammasome complexes are assembled on activation of certain nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat-containing proteins (NLR), AIM2-like receptors, or pyrin. Of these, NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRC4, NLRP6, and AIM2 influence the pathogenesis of cancer by modulating innate and adaptive immune responses, cell death, proliferation, and/or the gut microbiota. Activation of the inflammasome and IL18 signaling pathways is largely protective in colitis-associated colorectal cancer, whereas excessive inflammation driven by the inflammasome or the IL1 signaling pathways promotes breast cancer, fibrosarcoma, gastric carcinoma, and lung metastasis in a context-dependent manner. The clinical relevance of inflammasomes in multiple forms of cancer highlights their therapeutic promise as molecular targets. In this review, we explore the crossroads between inflammasomes and the development of various tumors and discuss possible therapeutic values in targeting the inflammasome for the prevention and treatment of cancer.",negative,,,,
31186547,The cancer microbiome,"Collectively known as the microbiota, the commensal bacteria and other microorganisms that colonize the epithelial surfaces of our body have been shown to produce small molecules and metabolites that have both local and systemic effects on cancer onset, progression and therapy response. To date, most studies focusing on the microbiome have used traditional preclinical mouse models and identified correlative relationships between microbial species and cancer phenotypes. Now, the profound influence of the microbiota on the efficacy of cancer treatments, such as immunotherapies, has begun to be extensively characterized in humans. Paramount to the development of microbiota-based therapeutics, the next challenge in microbiome research will be to identify individual microbial species that causally affect cancer phenotypes and unravel the underlying mechanisms. In this Viewpoint article, we asked four scientists working on the cancer microbiome for their opinions on the current state of the field, where the research is heading and how we can advance our understanding to rationally design microbial-based therapeutics to transform treatment strategies for patients with cancer.",negative,,,,
29703480,Arterial thrombosis and cancer,"Cancer-associated arterial thrombotic events (ATEs) are increasingly recognized in specific malignancies and in association with the expanding armamentarium of novel chemotherapeutic agents. The improved cancer survival led to cardiovascular complications becoming clinically relevant many years after cancer diagnosis. The pathobiology of ATEs in cancer is complex and the individual patient risk for an ATE entails a multifactorial interaction between the traditional cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities, the specific malignancy and selected therapy. Treatment with several specific chemotherapeutic agents, immunomodulatory drugs, vascular endothelial growth factor pathway inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and radiotherapy, impart increased risk for ATEs that result from specific therapy-related mechanisms, often involving endothelial injury. Cancer cell-specific prothrombotic properties are important players in the pathogenesis of cancer-associated hypercoagulability. There are distinct biological and molecular processes preferentially activated in specific cancer cells which can trigger ATEs, including platelet activation, increased expression of procoagulants and suppression of fibrinolytic activity. ATEs portend adverse prognosis in cancer patients. Prevention and treatment of cancer-associated ATEs may be improved by greater awareness and careful monitoring for vascular toxicity, aggressive effort to optimize conventional cardiovascular risk factors, and use of antiplatelet and antithrombotic agents in selected patients. These issues are targets for future studies aimed to reduce ATEs in patients with cancer.",negative,,,,

39419485,"Neutralization of the autophagy-repressive tissue hormone DBI/ACBP (diazepam binding inhibitor, acyl-CoA binding protein) enhances anticancer immunosurveillance","The plasma concentration of the macroautophagy/autophagy inhibitor DBI/ACBP (diazepam binding inhibitor, acyl-CoA binding protein) increases with aging and body mass index (BMI). Both advanced age and obesity are among the most important risk factors for the development of cancer. We observed that patients with cancer predisposition syndromes due to mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2 and TP53 exhibit abnormally high plasma DBI/ACBP levels. Additionally, patients without known cancer predisposition syndromes also manifest higher DBI/ACBP levels before imminent cancer diagnosis (within 0-3 years) as compared to age and BMI-matched controls who remain cancer-free. Thus, supranormal plasma DBI/ACBP constitutes a risk factor for later cancer development. Mouse experimentation revealed that genetic or antibody-mediated DBI/ACBP inhibition can delay the development or progression of cancers. In the context of chemoimmunotherapy, DBI/ACBP neutralization enhances tumor infiltration by non-exhausted effector T cells but reduces infiltration by regulatory T cells. This resulted in better cancer control in models of breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and sarcoma. We conclude that DBI/ACBP constitutes an actionable autophagy checkpoint for improving cancer immunosurveillance.",negative,,,,

35691301,Thalassaemia,"Thalassaemia is a diverse group of genetic disorders with a worldwide distribution affecting globin chain synthesis. The pathogenesis of thalassaemia lies in the unbalanced globin chain production, leading to ineffective erythropoiesis, increased haemolysis, and deranged iron homoeostasis. The clinical phenotype shows heterogeneity, ranging from close to normal without complications to severe requiring lifelong transfusion support. Conservative treatment with transfusion and iron chelation has transformed the natural history of thalassaemia major into a chronic disease with a prolonged life expectancy, albeit with co-morbidities and substantial disease burden. Curative therapy with allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is advocated for suitable patients. The understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease is guiding therapeutic advances. Novel agents have shown efficacy in improving anaemia and transfusion burden, and initial results from gene therapy approaches are promising. Despite scientific developments, worldwide inequality in the access of health resources is a major concern, because most patients live in underserved areas.",negative,,,,
26400113,Down syndrome--genetic and nutritional aspects of accompanying disorders,"Down syndrome (DS) is one of the more commonly occurring genetic disorders, where mental retardation is combined with nutritional diseases. It is caused by having a third copy of chromosome 21, and there exist 3 forms; Simple Trisomy 21, Translocation Trisomy and Mosaic Trisomy. Symptoms include intellectual disability/mental retardation, early onset of Alzheimer's disease and the appearance of various phenotypic features such as narrow slanted eyes, flat nose and short stature. In addition, there are other health problems throughout the body, consisting in part of cardiac defects and thyroid function abnormalities along with nutritional disorders (ie. overweight, obesity, hypercholesterolemia and deficiencies of vitamins and minerals). Those suffering DS have widespread body frame abnormalities and impaired brain development and function; the latter leading to impaired intellectual development. Many studies indicate excessive or deficient nutrient uptakes associated with making inappropriate foodstuff choices, food intolerance, (eg. celiac disease) or malabsorption. DS persons with overweight or obesity are linked with a slow metabolic rate, abnormal blood leptin concentrations and exhibit low levels of physical activity. Vitamin B group deficiencies and abnormal blood homocysteine levels decrease the rate of intellectual development in DS cases. Zinc deficiencies result in short stature, thyroid function disorders and an increased appetite caused by excessive supplementation. Scientific advances in the research and diagnosis of DS, as well as preventing any associated conditions, have significantly increased life expectancies of those with this genetic disorder. Early dietary interventions by parents or guardians of DS children afford an opportunity for decreasing the risk or delaying some of the DS associated conditions from appearing, thus beneficially impacting on their quality of life.",negative,,,,
33238136,CRISPR-Cas9: A Preclinical and Clinical Perspective for the Treatment of Human Diseases,"At present, the idea of genome modification has revolutionized the modern therapeutic research era. Genome modification studies have traveled a long way from gene modifications in primary cells to genetic modifications in animals. The targeted genetic modification may result in the modulation (i.e., either upregulation or downregulation) of the predefined gene expression. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated nuclease 9 (Cas9) is a promising genome-editing tool that has therapeutic potential against incurable genetic disorders by modifying their DNA sequences. In comparison with other genome-editing techniques, CRISPR-Cas9 is simple, efficient, and very specific. This enabled CRISPR-Cas9 genome-editing technology to enter into clinical trials against cancer. Besides therapeutic potential, the CRISPR-Cas9 tool can also be applied to generate genetically inhibited animal models for drug discovery and development. This comprehensive review paper discusses the origin of CRISPR-Cas9 systems and their therapeutic potential against various genetic disorders, including cancer, allergy, immunological disorders, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, cardiovascular disorders, neurological disorders, liver-related disorders, cystic fibrosis, blood-related disorders, eye-related disorders, and viral infection.

Currently, CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing has been becoming one of the most promising tools for treating human genetic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, neuro-disorders, and cancers. As the quick modification of the CRISPR/Cas9 system, including delivery system, CRISPR/Cas9-based gene therapy has been extensively studied in preclinic and clinic treatments. CRISPR/Cas genome editing is also a robust tool to create animal genetic models for studying and treating human genetic disorders, particularly diseases associated with point mutations. However, significant challenges also remain before CRISPR/Cas technology can be routinely employed in the clinic for treating different genetic diseases, which include toxicity and immune response of treated cells to CRISPR/Cas component, highly throughput delivery method, and potential off-target impact. The off-target effect is one of the major concerns for CRISPR/Cas9 gene therapy, more research should be focused on limiting this impact by designing high specific gRNAs and using high specificity of Cas enzymes. Modifying the CRISPR/Cas9 delivery method not only targets a specific tissue/cell but also potentially limits the off-target impact.",negative,,,,
32901917,"Diagnostic yield and clinical utility of whole exome sequencing using an automated variant prioritization system, EVIDENCE","EVIDENCE, an automated variant prioritization system, has been developed to facilitate whole exome sequencing analyses. This study investigated the diagnostic yield of EVIDENCE in patients with suspected genetic disorders. DNA from 330 probands (age range, 0-68 years) with suspected genetic disorders were subjected to whole exome sequencing. Candidate variants were identified by EVIDENCE and confirmed by testing family members and/or clinical reassessments. EVIDENCE reported a total 228 variants in 200 (60.6%) of the 330 probands. The average number of organs involved per patient was 4.5   5.0. After clinical reassessment and/or family member testing, 167 variants were identified in 141 probands (42.7%), including 105 novel variants. These variants were confirmed as being responsible for 121 genetic disorders. A total of 103 (61.7%) of the 167 variants in 95 patients were classified as pathogenic or probably to be pathogenic before, and 161 (96.4%) variants in 137 patients (41.5%) after, clinical assessment and/or family member testing.

37936448,Human DNA Mutations and their Impact on Genetic Disorders,"DNA is a remarkably precise medium for copying and storing biological information. It serves as a design for cellular machinery that permits cells, organs, and even whole organisms to work. The fidelity of DNA replication results from the action of hundreds of genes involved in proofreading and damage repair. All human cells can acquire genetic changes in their DNA all over life. Genetic mutations are changes to the DNA sequence that happen during cell division when the cells make copies of themselves. Mutations in the DNA can cause genetic illnesses such as cancer, or they could help humans better adapt to their environment over time. The endogenous reactive metabolites, therapeutic medicines, and an excess of environmental mutagens, such as UV rays all continuously damage DNA, compromising its integrity. One or more chromosomal alterations and point mutations at a single site (monogenic mutation) including deletions, duplications, and inversions illustrate such DNA mutations. Genetic conditions can occur when an altered gene is inherited from parents, which increases the risk of developing that particular condition, or some gene alterations can happen randomly. Moreover, symptoms of genetic conditions depend on which gene has a mutation. There are many different diseases and conditions caused by mutations. Some of the most common genetic conditions are Alzheimer's disease, some cancers, cystic fibrosis, Down syndrome, and sickle cell disease. Interestingly, scientists find that DNA mutations are more common than formerly thought. This review outlines the main DNA mutations that occur along the human genome and their influence on human health.

27124789,Clinical genomics can facilitate countrywide estimation of autosomal recessive disease burden," Background: Most autosomal recessive diseases are rare, but they collectively account for a substantial proportion of disease burden, especially in consanguineous populations. Estimation of this disease burden, however, is hampered by many factors, including lack of countrywide registries. Establishing carrier frequency can be a practical surrogate to estimate disease burden, although the requirement of a large representative cohort may be challenging.

Purpose: We propose that the application of clinical genomics in the diagnostic setting offers a unique opportunity to estimate carrier frequency in the population as a secondary benefit.

Methods: We used a data set of ~7,100 patients who underwent genomic testing for various Mendelian disorders to estimate the carrier frequency.

Results: We were able to calculate the frequency of 259 confirmed founder recessive mutations. We found the corresponding disease burden to be, at minimum, ~7 per 1,000 children born to first-cousin parents, with disorders related to intellectual disability and vision impairment being the most common.

Conclusion: Our approach can be utilized to inform the design of new policies for the prevention of genetic disorders and highlights an important secondary benefit of clinical genomics.",negative,,,,
26938574,Practice Bulletin No. 163: Screening for Fetal Aneuploidy,"Prenatal genetic screening is designed to assess whether a patient is at increased risk of having a fetus affected by a genetic disorder. In contrast, prenatal genetic diagnostic testing is intended to determine, with as much certainty as possible, whether a specific genetic disorder or condition is present in the fetus. The purpose of prenatal screening for aneuploidy is to provide an assessment of the woman's risk of carrying a fetus with one of the more common fetal aneuploidies. This is in contrast to prenatal diagnostic testing for genetic disorders, in which the fetal chromosomes are evaluated for the presence or absence of abnormalities in chromosome number, deletions, and duplications, or the fetal DNA is evaluated for specific genetic disorders. The wide variety of screening test options, each offering varying levels of information and accuracy, has resulted in the need for complex counseling by the health care provider and complex decision making by the patient. No one screening test is superior to other screening tests in all test characteristics. Each test has relative advantages and disadvantages. It is important that obstetrician-gynecologists and other obstetric care providers be prepared to discuss not only the risk of aneuploidy but also the benefits, risks, and limitations of available screening tests. Screening for aneuploidy should be an informed patient choice, with an underlying foundation of shared decision making that fits the patient's clinical circumstances, values, interests, and goals.The purpose of this Practice Bulletin is to provide current information regarding the available screening test options for fetal aneuploidy and to review their benefits, accuracy, and limitations.

36537975,The Dystrophinopathies,"

Purpose of review: This article reviews the history, epidemiology, genetics, clinical presentation, multidisciplinary management, and established and emerging therapies for the dystrophinopathies.

Recent findings: The multidisciplinary care of individuals with dystrophinopathies continues to improve in many ways, including early surveillance and implementation of respiratory, cardiac, and orthopedic health management. The era of genetic therapeutics has altered the treatment landscape in neuromuscular disorders, including the dystrophinopathies.

Summary: The dystrophinopathies are a spectrum of X-linked genetic disorders characterized by childhood-onset progressive weakness and variable cardiac and cognitive involvement. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy to slow disease progression. Additional strategies for disease amelioration and dystrophin restoration, including gene replacement therapy, are under investigation.

28973083,Use of Exome Sequencing for Infants in Intensive Care Units: Ascertainment of Severe Single-Gene Disorders and Effect on Medical Management,"

Importance: While congenital malformations and genetic diseases are a leading cause of early infant death, to our knowledge, the contribution of single-gene disorders in this group is undetermined.

Objective: To determine the diagnostic yield and use of clinical exome sequencing in critically ill infants.

Design, setting, and participants: Clinical exome sequencing was performed for 278 unrelated infants within the first 100 days of life who were admitted to Texas Children's Hospital in Houston, Texas, during a 5-year period between December 2011 and January 2017. Exome sequencing types included proband exome, trio exome, and critical trio exome, a rapid genomic assay for seriously ill infants.

Main outcomes and measures: Indications for testing, diagnostic yield of clinical exome sequencing, turnaround time, molecular findings, patient age at diagnosis, and effect on medical management among a group of critically ill infants who were suspected to have genetic disorders.

Results: The mean (SEM) age for infants participating in the study was 28.5 (1.7) days; of these, the mean (SEM) age was 29.0 (2.2) days for infants undergoing proband exome sequencing, 31.5 (3.9) days for trio exome, and 22.7 (3.9) days for critical trio exome. Clinical indications for exome sequencing included a range of medical concerns. Overall, a molecular diagnosis was achieved in 102 infants (36.7%) by clinical exome sequencing, with relatively low yield for cardiovascular abnormalities. The diagnosis affected medical management for 53 infants (52.0%) and had a substantial effect on informed redirection of care, initiation of new subspecialist care, medication/dietary modifications, and furthering life-saving procedures in select patients. Critical trio exome sequencing revealed a molecular diagnosis in 32 of 63 infants (50.8%) at a mean (SEM) of 33.1 (5.6) days of life with a mean (SEM) turnaround time of 13.0 (0.4) days. Clinical care was altered by the diagnosis in 23 of 32 patients (71.9%). The diagnostic yield, patient age at diagnosis, and medical effect in the group that underwent critical trio exome sequencing were significantly different compared with the group who underwent regular exome testing. For deceased infants (n = 81), genetic disorders were molecularly diagnosed in 39 (48.1%) by exome sequencing, with implications for recurrence risk counseling.

Conclusions and relevance: Exome sequencing is a powerful tool for the diagnostic evaluation of critically ill infants with suspected monogenic disorders in the neonatal and pediatric intensive care units and its use has a notable effect on clinical decision making.

Specific genodermatoses, including Netherton syndrome, epidermolysis bullosa pruriginosa, and hyper-IgE syndrome, are Th2 skewed diseases with activation of type 2 inflammation. We performed this systematic review to investigate the therapeutic role of dupilumab in the treatment of genodermatosis. A systematic search was conducted of the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases from inception to December 13, 2021. The review included studies with relevant terms including ""dupilumab,"" ""genodermatosis"", ""Netherton syndrome"", ""ichthyosis"", ""epidermolysis bullosa"" and ""hyper-IgE syndrome"". The initial search yielded 2,888 results, of which 28 studies and 37 patients with genodermatosis were enrolled. The assessed genodermatoses included Netherton syndrome, epidermolysis bullosa pruriginosa, hyper-IgE syndrome, Hailey-Hailey disease, and severe eczema associated with genetic disorders. Most of the reported cases showed significant clinical improvement after the initiation of dupilumab treatment without major adverse events. Decreased immunoglobulin E levels and cytokine normalization have also been documented. In conclusion, Dupilumab may have a potential therapeutic role in certain genodermatoses skewed towards T helper 2 (Th2) immunity, including Netherton syndrome, epidermolysis bullosa pruriginosa, hyper-IgE syndrome, Hailey-Hailey disease, and severe eczema associated with some genetic disorders.",negative,,,,

39265229,Genetic disorders in maternal medicine,"The role of genetic testing within maternal medicine is expanding. Advancing technology and the increasing availability of genetic testing have seen more patients receiving a genetic diagnosis than ever before. Improved healthcare and understanding of these rare diseases means that many patients are living well into their reproductive years and starting families. Individual diseases are considered by their patterns of inheritance i.e. autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant and chromosomal diseases. This chapter specifically addresses the following examples and outlines an approach to pre-conceptual and pregnancy management; autosomal recessive (cystic fibrosis, phenylketonuria), autosomal dominant (osteogenesis imperfecta, vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome) and chromosomal (Turner syndrome). For many rare and ultrarare genetic diseases, there may be no clear guidelines or consensus on the correct management in pregnancy. This chapter seeks to provide a framework for the clinician to use to address the unique needs and risk profile of these patients in pregnancy and pre-conceptually and plan accordingly. The role of pharmacogenetics in maternal medicine, the future of education in genetics for patients and clinicians and the important role of genetic counselling are all considered in this chapter. This overview highlights the important role of genetics in maternal medicine and how this can inform management and planning for the safe care of mother and baby.",negative,,,,
29790870,Genetic disorders and mortality in infancy and early childhood: delayed diagnoses and missed opportunities,"

Purpose: Infants admitted to a level IV neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) who do not survive early childhood are a population that is probably enriched for rare genetic disease; we therefore characterized their genetic diagnostic evaluation.

Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of infants admitted to our NICU between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2015 who were deceased at the time of records review, with age at death less than 5 years.

Results: A total of 2,670 infants were admitted; 170 later died. One hundred six of 170 (62%) had an evaluation for a genetic or metabolic disorder. Forty-seven of 170 (28%) had laboratory-confirmed genetic diagnoses, although 14/47 (30%) diagnoses were made postmortem. Infants evaluated for a genetic disorder spent more time in the NICU (median 13.5 vs. 5.0 days; p = 0.003), were older at death (median 92.0 vs. 17.5 days; p < 0.001), and had similarly high rates of redirection of care (86% vs. 79%; p = 0.28).

Conclusion: Genetic disorders were suspected in many infants but found in a minority. Approximately one-third of diagnosed infants died before a laboratory-confirmed genetic diagnosis was made. This highlights the need to improve genetic diagnostic evaluation in the NICU, particularly to support end-of-life decision making.

36534506,Rare diseases of ectoderm: Translating discovery to therapy,"Heritable conditions known as ectodermal dysplasias are rare and can be associated with marked morbidity, mortality, and a reduced quality of life. The diagnosis and care of individuals affected by one of the many ectodermal dysplasias presents myriad challenges due to their rarity and the diverse phenotypes. These conditions are caused by abnormalities in multiple genes and signaling pathways that are essential for the development and function of ectodermal derivatives. During a 2021 international conference focused on translating discovery to therapy, researchers and clinicians gathered with the goal of advancing the diagnosis and treatment of conditions affecting ectodermal tissues with an emphasis on skin, hair, tooth, and eye phenotypes. Conference participants presented a variety of promising treatment strategies including gene or protein replacement, gene editing, cell therapy, and the identification of druggable targets. Further, barriers that negatively influence the current development of novel therapeutics were identified. These barriers include a lack of accurate prevalence data for rare conditions, absence of an inclusive patient registry with deep phenotyping data, and insufficient animal models and cell lines. Overcoming these barriers will need to be prioritized in order to facilitate the development of novel treatments for genetic disorders of the ectoderm.",negative,,,,

Methods: We searched the prenatal records of all patients delivered in our hospital with a diagnosis of polyhydramnios during pregnancy. For each case, maternal characteristics, ultrasound findings, and genetic testing results were recorded. A postnatal follow-up program of at least 6 months, including a clinical assessment by a clinical geneticist, was carried out in all cases.

Results: On a total of 195 cases, genetic testing and clinical examination identified a chromosomal or genetic disease in 26 (13.3%) cases. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that significant predictors of a genetic disorder were a deepest vertical pocket of amniotic fluid of ?13.0 cm (OR 4.306, 95%CI: 1.535-12.079) and reduced fetal movements (OR 25.084, 95%CI: 4.577-137.461), but not the presence of a structural defect.

Background: The prevalence and cost of overweight and obesity are projected to continue to rise in our current sedentary, energy-rich environment. The heritability of obesity is reported to be 40-80%.

Objective: The objectives of this article are to review recent genetic discoveries about the basis of human obesity; describe familial or syndromic obesity, which is rare but presents early and should, if suspected, be referred for full specialist diagnosis of the underlying genetic disorder; and summarise immediate implications for general practice.

Discussion: Increasingly, specialised genetic studies are helping to unravel the complex physiology underlying the regulation and control of body fatness. Rare but serious syndromic obesity can now be identified early in life. Possible targets for future drug treatment are currently being found and tested, offering hope for the future. Understanding the heritable nature of obesity should also help to relieve the blame and guilt from the professional's approach to current weight management.

12447788,Behaviour phenotypes,"

Introduction: In the same way as the genetic basis of disease and developmental disorders with behavioural and intellectual features are being discovered, the opportunity of studying how genes may affect conduct is also developing in both dysfunctional and normal situations.

Development: The most useful models for studying this problem are the genetic disorders in which the genetic defect has been discovered or is being traced. In parallel with advances in genetics, the behaviour patterns found in each disorder are also being defined and are known as behaviour phenotypes.

Conclusions: In this article we aim to illustrate information currently available in the field of behaviour phenotypes. The behaviour and intellectual characteristics of the following syndromes are therefore described: fragile X, premutation of the fragile X syndrome, velocardiofacial, Prader Willi, Rett, Angelman and Williams.

11857546,Serious genetic disorders: can or should they be defined?,"The word ""serious"" appears in laws and policies regarding genetics services but is not defined. Genetics professionals would most likely be consulted if definitions are made. We surveyed all U.S. board-certified genetics services providers and all members of the European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG), Canadian College of Medical Geneticists (CCMG), and Ibero-American Society of Human Genetics (IASHG), using anonymous, mailed questionnaires. Respondents were asked to list three conditions they considered lethal, three that were serious but not lethal, and three that were not serious. Of 3,317 asked to respond, 1,481 (45%) returned questionnaires. Analysis was limited to responses of the 1,264 (85%) who saw patients. Respondents listed 537 conditions, with extensive overlap between categories; 46% of conditions listed as serious were also listed as not serious and 41% were listed as lethal. Respondents did not want professional societies, laws, or national ethics committees to define serious. They favored individual patients as decision makers, with the help of individual doctors. Their reasons were that genetic disorders vary in expression, individuals perceive disorders differently, professional or legal definitions could be unfair to minority groups, definitions tend to be inflexible when new treatments appear. In the United States, most would not use a definition of serious to limit reproductive services, carrier screening, or neonatal intensive care; outside the United States, more supported limitations. There is not sufficient consensus among experienced genetics professionals to define serious genetic conditions for purposes of law or policy. Responses point to social and economic influences on perceptions of what constitutes a serious genetic disorder. ",negative,,,,
34314210,The Unrecognized Mortality Burden of Genetic Disorders in Infancy,"Objectives. To determine how deaths of infants with genetic diagnoses are described in national mortality statistics. Methods. We present a retrospective cohort study of mortality data, obtained from the National Death Index (NDI), and clinical data for 517 infants born from 2011 to 2017 who died before 1 year of age in the United States. Results. Although 115 of 517 deceased infants (22%) had a confirmed diagnosis of a genetic disorder, only 61 of 115 deaths (53%) were attributed to International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision codes representing congenital anomalies or genetic disorders (Q00-Q99) as the underlying cause of death because of inconsistencies in death reporting. Infants with genetic diagnoses whose underlying causes of death were coded as Q00-Q99 were more likely to have chromosomal disorders than monogenic conditions (43/61 [70%] vs 18/61 [30%]; P < .001), which reflects the need for improved accounting for monogenic disorders in mortality statistics. Conclusions. Genetic disorders, although a leading cause of infant mortality, are not accurately captured by vital statistics. Public Health Implications. Expanded access to genetic testing and further clarity in death reporting are needed to describe properly the contribution of genetic disorders to infant mortality.",negative,,,,
39283673,Musculoskeletal Issues in Children and Adolescents: Genetic Musculoskeletal Disorders,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive genetic disorder with progressive proximal weakness as the principal sign. Glucocorticoids and physical therapy are the mainstay of treatment. Exercise intolerance is the hallmark of metabolic myopathies, which require a combination of laboratory testing, electrodiagnostic testing, and muscle biopsy for diagnosis. Joint hypermobility may be an isolated finding or be associated with hypermobility Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), other variants of EDS, or marfanoid syndromes. The latter conditions are associated with aortic and cardiac valvular abnormalities. Osteogenesis imperfecta encompasses a group of disorders characterized by bone fragility presenting with a low-impact fracture as a result of minimal trauma. Management includes multidiscipline specialists. Down syndrome (DS), or trisomy 21, is the most common chromosome abnormality identified in live births. Routine evaluation of atlantoaxial instability with x-ray is no longer recommended for children with DS without symptoms of atlantoaxial instability; however, clinical evaluation of symptoms is required for sports preparticipation. Achondroplasia is the most common skeletal dysplasia. Clinical signs are macrocephaly, short limb, short stature with disproportionately shorter humerus and femur, along with characteristic findings in pelvis and lumbar spine x-rays. Caregivers should be educated on proper positioning and handling to avoid complications, including car seat-related deaths.",negative,,,,
39138116,"Prenatal exome sequencing, a powerful tool for improving the description of prenatal features associated with genetic disorders","

Objective: Prenatal exome sequencing (pES) is now commonly used in clinical practice. It can be used to identifiy an additional diagnosis in around 30% of fetuses with structural defects and normal chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA). However, interpretation remains challenging due to the limited prenatal data for genetic disorders.

Method: We conducted an ancillary study including fetuses with pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants identified by trio-pES from the ""AnDDI-Prenatome"" study. The prenatal phenotype of each patient was categorized as typical, uncommon, or unreported based on the comparison of the prenatal findings with documented findings in the literature and public phenotype-genotype databases (ClinVar, HGMD, OMIM, and Decipher).

Results: Prenatal phenotypes were typical for 38/56 fetuses (67.9%). For the others, genotype-phenotype associations were challenging due to uncommon prenatal features (absence of recurrent hallmark, rare, or unreported). We report the first prenatal features associated with LINS1 and PGM1 variants. In addition, a double diagnosis was identified in three fetuses.

Conclusion: Standardizing the description of prenatal features, implementing longitudinal prenatal follow-up, and large-scale collection of prenatal features are essential steps to improving pES data interpretation.

The clinical presentation of many metabolic and genetic conditions, particularly in highly consanguineous populations, can mimic cerebral palsy particularly at early age. The aim of this review article is to identify the clinical features that should alert the physician to the possibility of disorders that resemble cerebral palsy, the clinical and neuroimaging red flags, and highlight some metabolic and genetic conditions which may present with spasticity, ataxia and dyskinesia.

31613565,Hematologic Conditions: Common Hemoglobinopathies,"Hemoglobinopathies are genetic disorders that lead to abnormal structure of the hemoglobin molecule. Genetic mutation results in major changes in the hemoglobin structure, with dysfunctions related to changes in shape, oxygen-carrying capacity, or ability to clump together, causing obstruction of the vascular system. Sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia major are two common hemoglobinopathies worldwide. However, they occur infrequently in the United States, with approximately 101,000 individuals affected. Sickle cell disease phenotypically is exhibited in patients with two hemoglobin S genes but the disease broadly includes many other hemoglobin abnormalities. Complications vary according to genotype and include acute pain crisis, vasoocclusive events, and acute chest syndrome. Blood transfusions are a mainstay of therapy. The two main categories of thalassemias are beta thalassemias and alpha thalassemias. Symptoms range from severe to none. The severity depends on how many genes are affected. Patients with the most severe form of beta thalassemia (ie, two affected genes) are categorized as having thalassemia major or transfusion-dependent disease. The primary treatment for beta thalassemia major currently is transfusions, although stem cell transplantation is a potentially curative option. ",negative,,,,
33849535,Characterizing sensitivity and coverage of clinical WGS as a diagnostic test for genetic disorders,"

Background: Due to its reduced cost and incomparable advantages, WGS is likely to lead to changes in clinical diagnosis of rare and undiagnosed diseases. However, the sensitivity and breadth of coverage of clinical WGS as a diagnostic test for genetic disorders has not been fully evaluated.

Methods: Here, the performance of WGS in NA12878, the YH cell line, and the Chinese trios were measured by assessing their sensitivity, PPV, depth and breadth of coverage using MGISEQ-2000. We also compared the performance of WES and WGS using NA12878. The sensitivity and PPV were tested using the family-based trio design for the Chinese trios. We further developed a systematic WGS pipeline for the analysis of 8 clinical cases.

Results: In general, the sensitivity and PPV for SNV/indel detection increased with mean depth and reached a plateau at an ~ 40X mean depth using down-sampling samples of NA12878. With a mean depth of 40X, the sensitivity of homozygous and heterozygous SNPs of NA12878 was > 99.25% and > 99.50%, respectively, and the PPV was 99.97% and 98.96%. Homozygous and heterozygous indels showed lower sensitivity and PPV. The sensitivity and PPV were still not 100% even with a mean depth of ~ 150X. We also observed a substantial variation in the sensitivity of CNV detection across different tools, especially in CNVs with a size less than 1 kb. In general, the breadth of coverage for disease-associated genes and CNVs increased with mean depth. The sensitivity and coverage of WGS (~ 40X) was better than WES (~ 120X). Among the Chinese trios with an ~ 40X mean depth, the sensitivity among offspring was > 99.48% and > 96.36% for SNP and indel detection, and the PPVs were 99.86% and 97.93%. All 12 previously validated variants in the 8 clinical cases were successfully detected using our WGS pipeline.

Conclusions: The current standard of a mean depth of 40X may be sufficient for SNV/indel detection and identification of most CNVs. It would be advisable for clinical scientists to determine the range of sensitivity and PPV for different classes of variants for a particular WGS pipeline, which would be useful when interpreting and delivering clinical reports.

15200965,Hemoglobinopathies in pregnancy ,"Hemoglobinopathies represent a unique set of genetic disorders. Formerly, many affected individuals did not survive to childbearing age. Affected women now commonly reach childbearing age and desire pregnancy. Successful pregnancy is possible in many cases with carefully coordinated obstetric and medical management. Genetic screening and prenatal diagnosis is an important aspect of prenatal care in these disorders. DNA mutation analysis offers rapid and accurate fetal diagnosis. Pregnancy also offers a unique situation in that cord blood has become a valuable source of stem cells for transplant. This allows the potential role of the unaffected fetus as a donor for affected siblings. In addition, it was proposed that the fetus may be able to act as a donor of stem cells for an affected mother. Despite current screening recommendations,many couples are not aware that they are carriers; it is common for a child to be born with an unexpected, serious hemoglobinopathies. For this reason, newborn screening programs have been introduced in most high-risk areas. Early diagnosis can facilitate implementation of proper preventive health measures, education of the parents regarding their carrier status, and provide the child with ongoing comprehensive care.",negative,,,,
27430466,"Metabolic, endocrine, and other genetic disorders","Metabolic, endocrine, and genetic diseases of the brain include a very large array of disorders caused by a wide range of underlying abnormalities and involving a variety of brain structures. Often these disorders manifest as recognizable, though sometimes overlapping, patterns on neuroimaging studies that may enable a diagnosis based on imaging or may alternatively provide enough clues to direct further diagnostic evaluation. The diagnostic workup can include various biochemical laboratory or genetic studies. In this chapter, after a brief review of normal white-matter development, we will describe a variety of leukodystrophies resulting from metabolic disorders involving the brain, including mitochondrial and respiratory chain diseases. We will then describe various acidurias, urea cycle disorders, disorders related to copper and iron metabolism, and disorders of ganglioside and mucopolysaccharide metabolism. Lastly, various other hypomyelinating and dysmyelinating leukodystrophies, including vanishing white-matter disease, megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts, and oculocerebrorenal syndrome will be presented. In the following section on endocrine disorders, we will examine various disorders of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, including developmental, inflammatory, and neoplastic diseases. Neonatal hypoglycemia will also be briefly reviewed. In the final section, we will review a few of the common genetic phakomatoses.

28368288,Genetic disorders of nuclear receptors,"Following the first isolation of nuclear receptor (NR) genes, genetic disorders caused by NR gene mutations were initially discovered by a candidate gene approach based on their known roles in endocrine pathways and physiologic processes. Subsequently, the identification of disorders has been informed by phenotypes associated with gene disruption in animal models or by genetic linkage studies. More recently, whole exome sequencing has associated pathogenic genetic variants with unexpected, often multisystem, human phenotypes. To date, defects in 20 of 48 human NR genes have been associated with human disorders, with different mutations mediating phenotypes of varying severity or several distinct conditions being associated with different changes in the same gene. Studies of individuals with deleterious genetic variants can elucidate novel roles of human NRs, validating them as targets for drug development or providing new insights into structure-function relationships. Importantly, human genetic discoveries enable definitive disease diagnosis and can provide opportunities to therapeutically manage affected individuals. Here we review germline changes in human NR genes associated with ""monogenic"" conditions, including a discussion of the structural basis of mutations that cause distinctive changes in NR function and the molecular mechanisms mediating pathogenesis.",negative,,,,

The statements that were written during the elaboration of the guidelines are presented here. The background document and full guidelines are available as supplementary material. They include many examples to assist the laboratories in the implementation of NGS and accreditation of this service. The work and ideas presented by others in guidelines that have emerged elsewhere in the course of the past few years were also considered and are acknowledged in the full text. Interestingly, a few new insights that have not been cited before have emerged during the preparation of the guidelines. The most important new feature is the presentation of a 'rating system' for NGS-based diagnostic tests. The guidelines and statements have been applauded by the genetic diagnostic community, and thus seem to be valuable for the harmonization and quality assurance of NGS diagnostics in Europe.",negative,,,,
31835360,Genetic Disorders Associated with Metal Metabolism,"Genetic disorders associated with metal metabolism form a large group of disorders and mostly result from defects in the proteins/enzymes involved in nutrient metabolism and energy production. These defects can affect different metabolic pathways and cause mild to severe disorders related to metal metabolism. Some disorders have moderate to severe clinical consequences. In severe cases, these elements accumulate in different tissues and organs, particularly the brain. As they are toxic and interfere with normal biological functions, the severity of the disorder increases. However, the human body requires a very small amount of these elements, and a deficiency of or increase in these elements can cause different genetic disorders to occur. Some of the metals discussed in the present review are copper, iron, manganese, zinc, and selenium. These elements may play a key role in the pathology and physiology of the nervous system.

17570314,Genetic disorders and congenital malformations in pediatric long-term care,"

Objective: The objective of this study was to gain insight into the contribution of genetic disorders and congenital malformations to residents of a pediatric long-term care and rehabilitation center.

Design: Record review.

Setting: The setting was a 136-bed long-term care and rehabilitation center in New York City.

Participants: Participants were residents who spent 1 day or longer as in-patients at the center over a 1-year period of time.

Measurements: Resident diagnoses were categorized as problems with known genetic basis, problems with presumed genetic basis, acquired disorders with genetic predisposition, contiguous gene syndromes, multiple congenital anomalies, prematurity, cerebral palsy, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, conditions with unknown etiology, and defined conditions without genetic basis. The percentage of individuals with genetic disorders and/or congenital malformations was determined.

Results: Genetic disorders and congenital anomalies were responsible for 50% of overall admissions and 60% of end-of-life care admissions to a pediatric long-term care center.

Conclusion: An understanding of the contribution of genetic disorders and congenital malformations can assist long-term care administrators as they plan for the needs of their future residents.

30925787,Mitochondrial Genetic Disorders: Cell Signaling and Pharmacological Therapies,"Mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and respiratory chain (RC) defects form a large group of inherited monogenic disorders sharing many common clinical and pathophysiological features, including disruption of mitochondrial bioenergetics, but also, for example, oxidative stress and accumulation of noxious metabolites. Interestingly, several transcription factors or co-activators exert transcriptional control on both FAO and RC genes, and can be activated by small molecules, opening to possibly common therapeutic approaches for FAO and RC deficiencies. Here, we review recent data on the potential of various drugs or small molecules targeting pivotal metabolic regulators: peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs), sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and protein kinase A (PKA)) or interacting with reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling, to alleviate or to correct inborn FAO or RC deficiencies in cellular or animal models. The possible molecular mechanisms involved, in particular the contribution of mitochondrial biogenesis, are discussed. Applications of these pharmacological approaches as a function of genotype/phenotype are also addressed, which clearly orient toward personalized therapy. Finally, we propose that beyond the identification of individual candidate drugs/molecules, future pharmacological approaches should consider their combination, which could produce additive or synergistic effects that may further enhance their therapeutic potential.",negative,,,,

39119747,"Severe Acute Motor Exacerbations (SAME) across Metabolic, Developmental and Genetic Disorders","Acute presentation of severe motor disorders is a diagnostic and management challenge. We define severe acute motor exacerbations (SAME) as acute/subacute motor symptoms that persist for hours-to-days with a severity that compromise vital signs (temperature, breath, and heart rate) and bulbar function (swallowing/dysphagia). Phenomenology includes dystonia, choreoathetosis, combined movement disorders, weakness, and hemiplegic attacks. SAME can develop in diverse diseases and can be preceded by triggers or catabolic states. Recent descriptions of SAME in complex neurodevelopmental and epileptic encephalopathies have broadened appreciation of this presentation beyond inborn errors of metabolism. A high degree of clinical suspicion is required to identify appropriately targeted investigations and management. We conducted a comprehensive literature analysis of etiologies. Reported triggers are described and classified as per pathophysiological mechanism. A video of six cases displaying multiple SAME with diverse outcomes is provided. We identified 50 different conditions that manifest SAME, some associated with developmental regression. Etiologies include disorders of metabolism: energy substrate, amino acids, complex molecules, vitamins/cofactors, minerals, and neurotransmitters/synaptic vesicle cycling. Non-metabolic neurodegenerative and genetic disorders that present with movement disorders and epilepsy can additionally manifest SAME. A limited number of triggers are grouped here, together with an approach to investigations and general management strategies. Several neurogenetic and neurometabolic disorders manifest SAME. Identifying triggers can help in certain cases narrow the differential diagnosis and guide the expeditious application of targeted therapies to minimize adverse developmental and neurological consequences. This process may inform pathogenesis and eventually improve our understanding of the mechanisms that lead to the development of SAME. ",negative,,,,

In this study, we integrated scRNA-seq data from non-diseased samples with known genetic disorder genes and phenotypic information to predict the specific cell types disrupted by pathogenic mutations for 482 disease phenotypes.

Results: We found significant phenotype-cell type associations focusing on differential expression and co-expression mechanisms. Our analysis revealed that 13% of the associations documented in the literature were captured through differential expression, while 42% were elucidated through co-expression analysis, also uncovering potential new associations. These findings underscore the critical role of cellular context in disease manifestation and highlight the potential of single-cell data for the development of cell-aware diagnostics and targeted therapies for rare diseases.

Background: Haemophilia is a genetic disorder characterized by spontaneous or provoked, often uncontrolled, bleeding into joints, muscles and other soft tissues. Current methods of treatment are expensive, challenging and involve regular administration of clotting factors. Gene therapy for haemophilia is a curative treatment modality currently under investigation. This is an update of a published Cochrane Review.

Objectives: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of gene therapy for treating people with haemophilia A or B.

Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis & Genetic Disorders Group's Coagulopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of last search: 17 April 2020.

Selection criteria: Eligible trials include randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials, including controlled clinical trials comparing gene therapy (with or without standard treatment) with standard treatment (factor replacement) or other 'curative' treatment such as stem cell transplantation for individuals with haemophilia A or B of all ages who do not have inhibitors to factor VIII or IX.

Data collection and analysis: No trials of gene therapy for haemophilia matching the inclusion criteria were identified.

Main results: No trials of gene therapy for haemophilia matching the inclusion criteria were identified.

Authors' conclusions: No randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials of gene therapy for haemophilia were identified. Thus, we are unable to determine the safety and efficacy of gene therapy for haemophilia. Gene therapy for haemophilia is still in clinical investigation and there is a need for well-designed clinical trials to assess the long-term feasibility, success and risks of gene therapy for people with haemophilia.

39125589,Navigating Lipodystrophy: Insights from Laminopathies and Beyond,"Recent research into laminopathic lipodystrophies-rare genetic disorders caused by mutations in the LMNA gene-has greatly expanded our knowledge of their complex pathology and metabolic implications. These disorders, including Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), Mandibuloacral Dysplasia (MAD), and Familial Partial Lipodystrophy (FPLD), serve as crucial models for studying accelerated aging and metabolic dysfunction, enhancing our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved. Research on laminopathies has highlighted how LMNA mutations disrupt adipose tissue function and metabolic regulation, leading to altered fat distribution and metabolic pathway dysfunctions. Such insights improve our understanding of the pathophysiological interactions between genetic anomalies and metabolic processes. This review merges current knowledge on the phenotypic classifications of these diseases and their associated metabolic complications, such as insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia, hepatic steatosis, and metabolic syndrome, all of which elevate the risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and diabetes. Additionally, a range of published therapeutic strategies, including gene editing, antisense oligonucleotides, and novel pharmacological interventions aimed at addressing defective adipocyte differentiation and lipid metabolism, will be explored. These therapies target the core dysfunctional lamin A protein, aiming to mitigate symptoms and provide a foundation for addressing similar metabolic and genetic disorders.",negative,,,,

30768852,Genetic Disorders of the Extracellular Matrix,"Mutations in the genes for extracellular matrix (ECM) components cause a wide range of genetic connective tissues disorders throughout the body. The elucidation of mutations and their correlation with pathology has been instrumental in understanding the roles of many ECM components. The pathological consequences of ECM protein mutations depend on its tissue distribution, tissue function, and on the nature of the mutation. The prevalent paradigm for the molecular pathology has been that there are two global mechanisms. First, mutations that reduce the production of ECM proteins impair matrix integrity largely due to quantitative ECM defects. Second, mutations altering protein structure may reduce protein secretion but also introduce dominant negative effects in ECM formation, structure and/or stability. Recent studies show that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, caused by mutant misfolded ECM proteins, makes a significant contribution to the pathophysiology. This suggests that targeting ER-stress may offer a new therapeutic strategy in a range of ECM disorders caused by protein misfolding mutations. ",negative,,,,

Objective: To determine the proportion of infant deaths occurring in the setting of a confirmed genetic disorder.

Study design: A retrospective analysis of the electronic medical records of infants born from 1 January, 2011 to 1 June, 2017, who died prior to 1 year of age.

Results: Five hundred and seventy three deceased infants were identified. One hundred and seventeen were confirmed to have a molecular or cytogenetic diagnosis in a clinical diagnostic laboratory and an additional seven were diagnosed by research testing for a total of 124/573 (22%) diagnosed infants. A total of 67/124 (54%) had chromosomal disorders and 58/124 (47%) had single gene disorders (one infant had both). The proportion of diagnoses made by sequencing technologies, such as exome sequencing, increased over the years.

Conclusions: The prevalence of confirmed genetic disorders within our cohort of infant deaths is higher than that previously reported. Increased efforts are needed to further understand the mortality burden of genetic disorders in infancy.

39322018,Genetic disorders and their association with morbidity and mortality in early preterm small for gestational age infants,"

Background: Early preterm (<34 weeks of gestation) small for gestational age infants (<10th percentile birth weight for sex and gestational age) experience high rates of morbidity and mortality, the causes of which are poorly understood. Mounting evidence suggests that genetic disorders contribute. Scarce data exist regarding the prevalence of genetic disorders and their contribution to morbidity and mortality.

Objective: This study aimed to determine the proportion of genetic disorders in early preterm small for gestational age infants (with and without congenital anomalies) compared to early preterm appropriate for gestational age infants and the association of genetic disorders with morbidity or mortality.

Study design: This is a retrospective cohort study of infants delivered at 23 and 0/7 to 33 and 6/7 weeks of gestation from 2000 to 2020 from the Pediatrix Clinical Data Warehouse. Data included diagnosed genetic disorders and congenital anomalies, baseline characteristics, and morbidity or mortality. We excluded cases of death in the delivery room before neonatal intensive care unit admission, multiple gestations, and cases transferred after birth or before death or discharge.

Results: We identified 223,431 early preterm infants, including 21,180 small for gestational age. Genetic disorders were present in 441 (2.3%) of small for gestational age infants without congenital anomalies, in 194 (10.8%) of small for gestational age infants with congenital anomalies, and in 304 (4.5%) of small for gestational age infants that experienced morbidity or mortality (with or without congenital anomalies). Trisomies 13, 18, and 21 were the most prevalent genetic disorders in these groups, together accounting for 145 small for gestational age infants without congenital anomalies, 117 small for gestational age infants with congenital anomalies, and 166 small for gestational age infants with morbidity or mortality (with or without congenital anomalies). Less prevalent genetic disorders consisted of other aneuploidy (45, X and 47, XXY), copy number variants (13q14 deletion syndrome, cri du chat syndrome, DiGeorge syndrome), and single gene disorders (cystic fibrosis, Fanconi anemia, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, hemophilia, hypophosphatasia, sickle cell disease, and thalassemia). Comparatively, genetic disorders were found in 1792 (1.0%) appropriate for gestational age infants without congenital anomalies, in 572 (5.8%) appropriate for gestational age infants with congenital anomalies, and 809 (2.0%) appropriate for gestational age infants that experienced morbidity or mortality (with or without congenital anomalies). Genetic disorders were associated with an adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 2.10 (1.89-2.33) of isolated small for gestational age and 12.84 (11.47-14.35) of small for gestational age accompanied by congenital anomalies. Genetic disorders were associated with an adjusted odds ratio of 2.24 (1.83-2.74) of morbidity or mortality.

Conclusion: These findings suggest that genetic disorders are more prevalent in early preterm small for gestational age infants, particularly those with congenital anomalies. These findings also suggest that genetic disorders are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. These associations were primarily driven by trisomies 13, 18, and 21. Genetic diagnoses in this cohort were made through routine clinical care, principally via karyotype, chromosomal microarray, and single gene testing. These findings support evolving clinical guidelines for genetic testing of small for gestational age infants. Our study is limited due to the lack of prospective, genome-wide testing.

32229141,Artificial Intelligence in Dermatology: A Primer,"Artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly important in dermatology, with studies reporting accuracy matching or exceeding dermatologists for the diagnosis of skin lesions from clinical and dermoscopic images. However, real-world clinical validation is currently lacking. We review dermatological applications of deep learning, the leading artificial intelligence technology for image analysis, and discuss its current capabilities, potential failure modes, and challenges surrounding performance assessment and interpretability. We address the following three primary applications: (i) teledermatology, including triage for referral to dermatologists; (ii) augmenting clinical assessment during face-to-face visits; and (iii) dermatopathology. We discuss equity and ethical issues related to future clinical adoption and recommend specific standardization of metrics for reporting model performance.",negative,,,,
38969632,Pre-trained multimodal large language model enhances dermatological diagnosis using SkinGPT-4,"Large language models (LLMs) are seen to have tremendous potential in advancing medical diagnosis recently, particularly in dermatological diagnosis, which is a very important task as skin and subcutaneous diseases rank high among the leading contributors to the global burden of nonfatal diseases. Here we present SkinGPT-4, which is an interactive dermatology diagnostic system based on multimodal large language models. We have aligned a pre-trained vision transformer with an LLM named Llama-2-13b-chat by collecting an extensive collection of skin disease images (comprising 52,929 publicly available and proprietary images) along with clinical concepts and doctors' notes, and designing a two-step training strategy. We have quantitatively evaluated SkinGPT-4 on 150 real-life cases with board-certified dermatologists. With SkinGPT-4, users could upload their own skin photos for diagnosis, and the system could autonomously evaluate the images, identify the characteristics and categories of the skin conditions, perform in-depth analysis, and provide interactive treatment recommendations.",negative,,,,
25046455,Dermatology on instagram,"The novel photo-sharing social networking platform, Instagram, has an impressive following of 75 million daily users, with a predominantly younger and female demographic. This study investigated the presence of dermatology-related content on Instagram. The most popular professional dermatological organizations, dermatology journals, and dermatology related patient advocate groups on Facebook and Twitter, determined from a prior study, were searched for established profiles on Instagram. In addition, dermatology-related terms (i.e. dermatology, dermatologist, alopecia, eczema, melanoma, psoriasis, and skin cancer) and dermatology-related hashtags (i.e. #dermatology, #dermatologist, #melanoma, #acne, #psoriasis, and #alopecia) were searched. None of the top ten dermatological journals or professional dermatological organizations were found on Instagram. Although only one of the top ten patient advocate groups related to dermatology conditions, Melanoma Research Foundation, had an Instagram presence, there were many private offices, cosmetic products, and some patient advocacy groups. This novel social networking platform could grant dermatology journals and other professional organizations a unique opportunity to reach younger demographic populations, particularly women, with the potential for true educational and life-changing impact.

36457145,Clinical techniques in veterinary dermatology: Dermoscopy,"Dermoscopy is a noninvasive, painless, easy-to-perform technique used in human and veterinary medicine for rapid and magnified in vivo observation of dermatological lesions and disease. Dermoscopy can lead to a swifter diagnosis and may eliminate the need to perform more invasive diagnostic testing such as skin biopsies. To perform dermoscopy, the clinician needs a dermoscope and a software program equipped with image capture for pattern identification. Two techniques exist for dermoscopy: standard contact, where the dermoscope is applied directly to the patient's skin with the use of a liquid interface, or noncontact, where there is no direct contact between the skin and the dermoscope. The most important criteria to be considered when using dermoscopy are the morphology/arrangement of vascular structures, scaling patterns, colours, follicular abnormalities and specific disease features. Application of dermoscopic findings should always be correlated with the patient's history, clinical signs and the morphology of the skin lesions. Dermoscopy does require an initial financial and time investment by the clinician, yet this technique can quickly and easily help to identify patterns of disease that correlate with clinical diagnosis of dermatological disease.",negative,,,,
31530270,Skin Ageing: Pathophysiology and Current Market Treatment Approaches,"Ageing is a natural phenomenon which is a fold, ridge and crease in the skin that occurs due to loss of body mass, poor hydration, disintegration of dermis and epidermis junction. The Skin ageing process involves many changes that occur due to the combination of both endogenous factors (gene mutation, cellular metabolism, and hormonal factor) and exogenous factors (U.V, pollutants, chemical, and toxins). In 1950, the number of older people were found to be almost 205 million across the globe. But this number almost got 4 times by the year 2012 and the number of older persons increased to a massive amount of 810 million. The ageing of the skin occurs due to various mechanisms like glycation, free radical, cell cycle, and cellular and molecular mechanism of skin ageing. In this review article, we have discussed the treatment, worldwide newer therapies and marketed formulation that are currently available for the reduction of skin ageing. The most promising and revolutionizing field of nanotechnology is mostly applied in the field of dermatology, cosmetics, and biomedical applications. Nanotechnology also plays a vital role in increasing the efficacy of the product. ",negative,,,,
37230920,JAK-STAT pathway inhibitors in dermatology,"The JAK-STAT signaling pathway mediates important cellular processes such as immune response, carcinogenesis, cell differentiation, division and death. Therefore, drugs that interfere with different JAK-STAT signaling patterns have potential indications for various medical conditions. The main dermatological targets of JAK-STAT pathway inhibitors are inflammatory or autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis, vitiligo, atopic dermatitis and alopecia areata; however, several dermatoses are under investigation to expand this list of indications. As JAK-STAT pathway inhibitors should gradually occupy a relevant space in dermatological prescriptions, this review presents the main available drugs, their immunological effects, and their pharmacological characteristics, related to clinical efficacy and safety, aiming to validate the best dermatological practice.",negative,,,,
11442744,A comprehensive guide for the accurate classification of murine hair follicles in distinct hair cycle stages,"Numerous strains of mice with defined mutations display pronounced abnormalities of hair follicle cycling, even in the absence of overt alterations of the skin and hair phenotype; however, in order to recognize even subtle, hair cycle-related abnormalities, it is critically important to be able to determine accurately and classify the major stages of the normal murine hair cycle. In this comprehensive guide, we present pragmatic basic and auxiliary criteria for recognizing key stages of hair follicle growth (anagen), regression (catagen) and quiescence (telogen) in C57BL/6NCrlBR mice, which are largely based on previous work from other authors. For each stage, a schematic drawing and representative micrographs are provided in order to illustrate these criteria. The basic criteria can be employed for all mouse strains and require only routine histochemical techniques. The auxiliary criteria depend on the immunohistochemical analysis of three markers (interleukin-1 receptor type I, transforming growth factor-beta receptor type II, and neural cell-adhesion molecule), which allow a refined analysis of anatomical hair follicle compartments during all hair cycle stages. In contrast to prior staging systems, we suggest dividing anagen III into three distinct substages, based on morphologic differences, onset and progression of melanogenesis, and the position of the dermal papilla in the subcutis. The computer-generated schematic representations of each stage are presented with the aim of standardizing reports on follicular gene and protein expression patterns. This guide should become a useful tool when screening new mouse mutants or mice treated with pharmaceuticals for discrete morphologic abnormalities of hair follicle cycling in a highly reproducible, easily applicable, and quantifiable manner.",negative,,,,
27279294,Topical corticosteroids in dermatology,"Since their introduction, topical corticosteroids have become indispensable in the treatment of various dermatoses. Hydrocortisone was the first compound. Modifications in the basic structure generated in vivo activity and thus different topically active compounds were discovered. Apart from the Stoughton vasoconstrictor assay, various other methods are used for potency assessment of topical corticosteroids. Topical corticosteroides are classified based upon potency and action of these molecules. Mechanism of action at the cellular level and indications of topical corticosteroid use have been discussed. Various adverse effects often occur as an extension of their activity combined with inappropriate usage. Tachyphylaxis and contact allergy are potential problems in clinical practice. Newer compounds with improved risk-benefit ratio are available. ",negative,,,,
31849996,Emerging Topical and Systemic JAK Inhibitors in Dermatology,"Accumulating data on cellular and molecular pathways help to develop novel therapeutic strategies in skin inflammation and autoimmunity. Examples are psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, two clinically and immunologically well-defined disorders. Here, the elucidation of key pathogenic factors such as IL-17A/IL-23 on the one hand and IL-4/IL-13 on the other hand profoundly changed our therapeutic practice. The knowledge on intracellular pathways and governing factors is shifting our attention to new druggable molecules. Multiple cytokine receptors signal through Janus kinases (JAKs) and associated signal transducer and activators of transcription (STATs). Inhibition of JAKs can simultaneously block the function of multiple cytokines. Therefore, JAK inhibitors (JAKi) are emerging as a new class of drugs, which in dermatology can either be used systemically as oral drugs or locally in topical formulations. Inhibition of JAKs has been shown to be effective in various skin disorders. The first oral JAKi have been recently approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis. Currently, multiple inhibitors of the JAK/STAT pathway are being investigated for skin diseases like alopecia areata, atopic dermatitis, dermatomyositis, graft-versus-host-disease, hidradenitis suppurativa, lichen planus, lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, and vitiligo. Here, we aim to discuss the immunological basis and current stage of development of JAKi in dermatology. ",negative,,,,
32016458,Roles of inflammation factors in melanogenesis (Review),"The occurrence of hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation after inflammation is a common condition in dermatology and cosmetology. Since the exact mechanism of its occurrence is not yet known, prevention and treatment are troublesome. Previous studies have confirmed that ??melanocyte?stimulating hormone, stem cell factor and other factors can promote melanogenesis?related gene expression through the activation of signaling pathways. Recent studies have revealed that a variety of inflammatory mediators can also participate in the regulation of melanogenesis in melanocytes. In this review, we summarized that interleukin?18, interleukin?33, granulocyte?macrophage colony stimulating factor, interferon??, prostaglandin E2 have the effect of promoting melanogenesis, while interleukin?1, interleukin?4, interleukin?6, interleukin?17 and tumor necrosis factor can inhibit melanogenesis. Further studies have found that these inflammatory factors may activate or inhibit melanogenesis?related signaling pathways (such as protein kinase A and mitogen activated protein kinase) by binding to corresponding receptors, thereby promoting or inhibiting the expression of melanogenesis?related genes and regulating skin pigmentation processes. This suggests that the development of drugs or treatment methods from the perspective of regulating inflammation can provide new ideas and new targets for the treatment of pigmented dermatosis. This review outlines the current understanding of the inflammation factors' roles in melanogenesis.",negative,,,,
30374901,"Toxic Side Effects of Targeted Therapies and Immunotherapies Affecting the Skin, Oral Mucosa, Hair, and Nails","Targeted therapies and immunotherapies are associated with a wide range of dermatologic adverse events (dAEs) resulting from common signaling pathways involved in malignant behavior and normal homeostatic functions of the epidermis and dermis. Dermatologic toxicities include damage to the skin, oral mucosa, hair, and nails. Acneiform rash is the most common dAE, observed in 25-85% of patients treated by epidermal growth factor receptor and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitors. BRAF inhibitors mostly induce secondary skin tumors, squamous cell carcinoma and keratoacanthomas, changes in pre-existing pigmented lesions, as well as hand-foot skin reactions and maculopapular hypersensitivity-like rash. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) most frequently induce nonspecific maculopapular rash, but also eczema-like or psoriatic lesions, lichenoid dermatitis, xerosis, and pruritus. Of the oral mucosal toxicities observed with targeted therapies, oral mucositis is the most frequent with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, followed by stomatitis associated to multikinase angiogenesis and HER inhibitors, geographic tongue, oral hyperkeratotic lesions, lichenoid reactions, and hyperpigmentation. ICIs typically induce oral lichenoid reactions and xerostomia. Targeted therapies and endocrine therapy also commonly induce alopecia, although this is still underreported with the latter. Finally, targeted therapies may damage nail folds, with paronychia and periungual pyogenic granuloma distinct from chemotherapy-induced lesions. Mild onycholysis, brittle nails, and a slower nail growth rate may also be observed. Targeted therapies and immunotherapies often profoundly diminish patients' quality of life, which impacts treatment outcomes. Close collaboration between dermatologists and oncologists is therefore essential. ",negative,,,,
38666916,Precision Dermatology: A Review of Molecular Biomarkers and Personalized Therapies,"The evolution of personalized medicine in dermatology signifies a transformative shift towards individualized treatments, driven by the integration of biomarkers. These molecular indicators serve beyond diagnostics, offering insights into disease staging, prognosis, and therapeutic monitoring. Specific criteria guide biomarker selection, ensuring attributes like specificity, sensitivity, cost feasibility, stability, rapid detection, and reproducibility. This literature review, based on data from PubMed, SCOPUS, and Web of Science, explores biomarkers in Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS), Psoriasis, Atopic Dermatitis (AD), Alopecia Areata (AA), Vitiligo, and Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU). In HS, TNF-?, IL-1?, and MMPs serve as biomarkers, influencing targeted therapies like adalimumab and anakinra. Psoriasis involves biomarkers such as TNF-?, IL-23, and HLA genes, shaping treatments like IL23 and IL17 inhibitors. AD biomarkers include ECP, IL-4, IL-13, guiding therapies like dupilumab and tralokinumab. For AA, lipocalin-2, cytokines, and genetic polymorphisms inform JAK inhibitors' use. Vitiligo biomarkers range from cytokines to genetic markers like TYR, TYRP1, guiding treatments like JAK inhibitors. CSU biomarkers encompass IgE, cytokines, and autologous serum tests, influencing therapies like omalizumab and cyclosporine. Comparing conditions, common proinflammatory markers reveal limited specificity. While some biomarkers aid diagnosis and standard treatments, others hold more scientific than clinical value. Precision medicine, driven by biomarkers, has shown success in skin malignancies. Future directions involve AI-powered algorithms, nanotechnology, and multi-omics integration for personalized dermatological care. ",negative,,,,
33307146,Paradoxical eruptions to targeted therapies in dermatology: A systematic review and analysis,"

Background: Antibody-based therapies that inhibit proinflammatory cytokine signaling are commonly used in dermatology. Paradoxically, these medications may induce or exacerbate inflammatory disorders.

Objective: To summarize the spectrum of manifestations, incidence, timing, potential mechanisms of, and general management approaches to paradoxical cutaneous reactions induced by cytokine-targeted antibodies in dermatology.

Methods: We performed a systematic review and analysis of published cases of cutaneous paradoxical reactions (PRs) reported in association with tumor necrosis factor ?, interleukin (IL) 12/23 (p40), IL-17A/17R, IL-23 (p19), and IL-4R? inhibitors.

Results: We identified 313 articles reporting 2049 cases of PRs. Tumor necrosis factor ? inhibitors resulted in 91.2% (1869/2049) of all cases, followed by IL-17/17R (3.5%), IL-4R? (2.7%), IL-12/23 (2.4%), and IL-23 (0.01%) inhibitors. Psoriasiform and eczematous eruptions were the most commonly reported, but a wide spectrum of patterns were described. Phenotypically overlapping reaction patterns were common. Time to onset typically ranged from weeks to months but could occur more than a year later. Improvement or resolution upon discontinuation of the inciting drug was common.

Limitations: This was a retrospective analysis.

Conclusions: Familiarity with the clinical features of PRs from cytokine-blocking antibodies may facilitate efficient recognition and management.

38031699,"Janus-kinase inhibitors in dermatology: A review of their use in psoriasis, vitiligo, systemic lupus erythematosus, hidradenitis suppurativa, dermatomyositis, lichen planus, lichen planopilaris, sarcoidosis and graft-versus-host disease","Recent studies on molecular pathways have elucidated novel therapeutic approaches in inflammatory and autoimmune skin disorders. Specifically, the dysregulation of the Janus kinase signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) cascade plays a central role in the pathogenesis of many skin conditions. JAK inhibitors, with their ability to selectively target immune responses, are potential treatment options. Using the National Library of Medicine, we provide a comprehensive review of the use of United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved and emerging JAK or tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) inhibitors in a wide range of dermatologic conditions, including psoriasis, vitiligo, systemic lupus erythematosus, hidradenitis suppurativa, dermatomyositis, lichen planus, lichen planopilaris, sarcoidosis and graft-versus-host disease. In patients with psoriasis, oral deucravacitinib (TYK2 inhibitor) has been approved as a once-daily therapy with demonstrated superiority and efficacy over apremilast and placebo and tolerable safety profiles. In patients with vitiligo, topical ruxolitinib (JAK1 inhibitor) is approved as a twice-daily treatment for repigmentation. The efficacy of several other JAK inhibitors has also been demonstrated in several clinical trials and case studies for systemic lupus erythematosus, hidradenitis suppurativa, dermatomyositis, lichen planus, lichen planopilaris, sarcoidosis and graft-versus-host disease. Further investigations with long-term clinical trials are necessary to confirm their utility in treatment and safety for these diseases. ",negative,,,,
35081305,"Janus Kinase and Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors in Dermatology: A Review of Their Utilization, Safety Profile and Future Applications","Janus kinase inhibitors, also commonly referred to as JAK inhibitors, are a novel drug class that target and block cytokine signaling mediated by the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway, thereby regulating immune response and cell growth. Although JAK inhibitors are mainly used for rheumatological conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, their application in the field of dermatology is actively being investigated. Tofacitinib is US FDA-approved for psoriatic arthritis and showing promise for treating psoriasis. Most recently, regulatory approvals for the US were gained by ruxolitinib as a first-inclass, selective, topical therapy for atopic dermatitis and oral upadacitinib for active psoriatic psoriasis. Additionally, abrocitinib and upadacitinib have demonstrated efficacy in atopic dermatitis and are pending FDA approval for this indication. The therapeutic potential of JAK inhibitors in dermatological conditions such as alopecia areata, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, vitiligo, and dermatomyositis are showing promising results in clinical trials. Adverse events for JAK inhibitors seem to be similar to that of biologic drugs. Common adverse effects include increased risk of infections and thromboembolic events. Further investigation is needed to not only better understand the safety profile of JAK inhibitors, but also their full utility within the field of dermatology.",negative,,,,

32113942,European interdisciplinary guideline on invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the skin: Part 2. Treatment,"In order to update recommendations on treatment, supportive care, education and follow-up of patients with invasive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), a multidisciplinary panel of experts from the European Dermatology Forum, the European Association of Dermato-Oncology and the European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer was formed. Recommendations were based on evidence-based literature review, guidelines and expert consensus. Treatment recommendations are presented for common primary cSCC (low risk, high risk), locally advanced cSCC, regional metastatic cSCC (operable or inoperable) and distant metastatic cSCC. For common primary cSCC (the most frequent cSCC type), first-line treatment is surgical excision with postoperative margin assessment or microscopically controlled sugery. Safety margins containing clinical normal-appearing tissue around the tumour during surgical excision and negative margins as reported in the pathology report are necessary to minimise the risk of local recurrence and metastasis. In case of positive margins, a re-excision shall be done, for operable cases. Lymph node dissection is recommended for cSCC with cytologically or histologically confirmed regional nodal involvement. Radiotherapy should be considered as curative treatment for inoperable cSCC, or for non-surgical candidates. Anti-PD-1 antibodies are the first-line systemic treatment for patients with metastatic or locally advanced cSCC who are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation, with cemiplimab being the first approved systemic agent for advanced cSCC by the Food and Drug Administration/European Medicines Agency. Second-line systemic treatments for advanced cSCC include epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (cetuximab) combined with chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Multidisciplinary board decisions are mandatory for all patients with advanced disease who require more than surgery. Patients should be engaged with informed decisions on management and be provided with best supportive care to optimise symptom management and improve quality of life. Frequency of follow-up visits and investigations for subsequent new cSCC depend on underlying risk characteristics.",negative,,,,
