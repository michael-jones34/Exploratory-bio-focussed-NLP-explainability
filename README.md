ML Pathogen Abstracts Classification

Overview



This project implements text classification models to identify pathogen-related medical abstracts. It includes both a simple Bag-of-Words (BoW) + Logistic Regression model and a BioBERT-based model. The repository contains code, notebooks, and the BoW model; the BioBERT model is not included due to size.



Environment and Dependencies



Python 3.12



Key libraries used: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, shap, lime, captum, torch, transformers, joblib, IPython



A .venv folder can be used to manage dependencies. Some packages may require manual installation.



requirements.txt is provided, but some versions may be incompatible with Python 3.12; users may need to install packages manually if errors occur.



Data



Place the gold dataset at:



data/Pathogen\_abstracts\_gold\_dataset.csv





The dataset should have the following columns: id, title, abstract, label.



Models



BoW model: included in models/BoW/



BioBERT model: not included; to run BioBERT cells, please download the model from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cGQbbr381Di96oxDf\_0dePD5axTVFrc8/view?usp=sharing and place in:



models/BioBERT/



Running the Notebook



Open notebooks/abstracts\_recognition.ipynb in Jupyter.



Run all cells top-to-bottom, although only run BioBERT and Captum if you are willing to wait!



Ensure the correct working directory: the notebook expects paths relative to the notebooks folder.



Notes



Some exploratory analysis cells exist; they may produce extra output or visualizations.



All paths are relative to the repository root unless otherwise specified.



Outputs, plots, and intermediate files are generated by the notebook when executed.



Future Work



A full writeup of methods, results etc. will be added later. Current README ensures the repository is runnable for submission purposes.
