31367975,"CRISPR-Cas9 Probing of Infectious Diseases and Genetic Disorders /// The ability to precisely change the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) bases at specific sites offers tremendous advantages in the field of molecular biology and medical biotechnology. Identification of Clustered Regularly-Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR), revelation of its role in prokaryotic adaptive immunity and subsequent conversion into genome and epigenome engineering system are the landmark research progresses of the decade. The possibilities of deciphering the molecular mechanisms of the disease, identifying the disease targets, generating the disease models, validating the drug targets, developing resistance to the infection and correcting the genotype have brought off much enthusiasm in the field of infectious diseases and genetic disorders. This review focuses on CRISPR/Cas9's impact in the field of infection and genetic disorders.",0,1,0.9947069,0.9947069
31885873,"Comparison of Japanese and Indian intestinal microbiota shows diet-dependent interaction between bacteria and fungi  /// The bacterial species living in the gut mediate many aspects of biological processes such as nutrition and activation of adaptive immunity. In addition, commensal fungi residing in the intestine also influence host health. Although the interaction of bacterium and fungus has been shown, its precise mechanism during colonization of the human intestine remains largely unknown. Here, we show interaction between bacterial and fungal species for utilization of dietary components driving their efficient growth in the intestine. Next generation sequencing of fecal samples from Japanese and Indian adults revealed differential patterns of bacterial and fungal composition. In particular, Indians, who consume more plant polysaccharides than Japanese, harbored increased numbers of Prevotella and Candida. Candida spp. showed strong growth responses to the plant polysaccharide arabinoxylan in vitro. Furthermore, the culture supernatants of Candida spp. grown with arabinoxylan promoted rapid proliferation of Prevotella copri. Arabinose was identified as a potential growth-inducing factor in the Candida culture supernatants. Candida spp. exhibited a growth response to xylose, but not to arabinose, whereas P. copri proliferated in response to both xylose and arabinose. Candida spp., but not P. copri, colonized the intestine of germ-free mice. However, P. copri successfully colonized mouse intestine already harboring Candida. These findings demonstrate a proof of concept that fungal members of gut microbiota can facilitate a colonization of the intestine by their bacterial counterparts, potentially mediated by a dietary metabolite.",0,1,0.9936016,0.9936016
