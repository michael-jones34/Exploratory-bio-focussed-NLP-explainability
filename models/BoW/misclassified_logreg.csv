37734419,"Pathobionts in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Origins, Underlying Mechanisms, and Implications for Clinical Care /// The gut microbiota plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of both forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), namely, Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Although evidence suggests dysbiosis and loss of beneficial microbial species can exacerbate IBD, many new studies have identified microbes with pathogenic qualities, termed ""pathobionts,"" within the intestines of patients with IBD. The concept of pathobionts initiating or driving the chronicity of IBD has largely focused on the putative aggravating role that adherent invasive Escherichia coli may play in CD. However, recent studies have identified additional bacterial and fungal pathobionts in patients with CD and UC. This review will highlight the characteristics of these pathobionts and their implications for IBD treatment. Beyond exploring the origins of pathobionts, we discuss those associated with specific clinical features and the potential mechanisms involved, such as creeping fat (Clostridium innocuum) and impaired wound healing (Debaryomyces hansenii) in patients with CD as well as the increased fecal proteolytic activity (Bacteroides vulgatus) seen as a biomarker for UC severity. Finally, we examine the potential impact of pathobionts on current IBD therapies, and several new approaches to target pathobionts currently in the early stages of development. Despite recognizing that pathobionts likely contribute to the pathogenesis of IBD, more work is needed to define their modes of action. Determining whether causal relationships exist between pathobionts and specific disease characteristics could pave the way for improved care for patients, particularly for those not responding to current IBD therapies.

31885873,"Comparison of Japanese and Indian intestinal microbiota shows diet-dependent interaction between bacteria and fungi  /// The bacterial species living in the gut mediate many aspects of biological processes such as nutrition and activation of adaptive immunity. In addition, commensal fungi residing in the intestine also influence host health. Although the interaction of bacterium and fungus has been shown, its precise mechanism during colonization of the human intestine remains largely unknown. Here, we show interaction between bacterial and fungal species for utilization of dietary components driving their efficient growth in the intestine. Next generation sequencing of fecal samples from Japanese and Indian adults revealed differential patterns of bacterial and fungal composition. In particular, Indians, who consume more plant polysaccharides than Japanese, harbored increased numbers of Prevotella and Candida. Candida spp. showed strong growth responses to the plant polysaccharide arabinoxylan in vitro. Furthermore, the culture supernatants of Candida spp. grown with arabinoxylan promoted rapid proliferation of Prevotella copri. Arabinose was identified as a potential growth-inducing factor in the Candida culture supernatants. Candida spp. exhibited a growth response to xylose, but not to arabinose, whereas P. copri proliferated in response to both xylose and arabinose. Candida spp., but not P. copri, colonized the intestine of germ-free mice. However, P. copri successfully colonized mouse intestine already harboring Candida. These findings demonstrate a proof of concept that fungal members of gut microbiota can facilitate a colonization of the intestine by their bacterial counterparts, potentially mediated by a dietary metabolite.",0,1,0.5827466721581517,0.5827466721581517
